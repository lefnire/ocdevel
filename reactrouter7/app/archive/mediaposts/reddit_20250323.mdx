Treadmill Desks: Walking Pads Comparison Tool

[Walking Pads Comparison Tool](https://ocdevel.com/walk)

I'm creating a big comparison of popular walking pads. I'll add one treadmill per day, starting with the most frequently recommended; then filling out each brands' full inventory. WalkingPad / KingSmith / Xiaomi, Urevo, EgoFit, GoPlus, Sperax, Sunny Health, Yagud, GoYouth, SupeRun, Elseluck, Lichico, Rythm Fun, DeerRun, etc.

I keep seeing review sites dumping lists of poor products; presumably a web-scrape of Amazon sorted by popularity. This popularity tends towards fake reviews (use FakeSpot!); time in the game (age is generally bad, the tech improves); or SEO (I'm looking at you WalkingPad). Mine is a tool from someone obsessed with walking pads. I sleuth these subreddits like a maniac, am part of Discords, etc. I'm currently a Urevo boy, but I'll keep testing treadmills and changing that page. I *really* want to try Walkolution 2, but god that price...

I [went on a journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/treadmills/comments/v5l30p/walking_desks_how_bad_are_the_cheaps_vs_the/) of GoYouth -> EgoFit -> Urevo, and got lots of engagement in the process, so I wanted a sophisticated ranking system to make choosing easier. The Rank column is a weighted sum of each products' attribute-score. Weighted because some attributes are more important. And attribute scores themselves have complex logic. Eg dimensions is "how does each dimension (of 3) rank relative to the tables' min/max". And Rating is "star-rating (Amazon), down-weighted if too few ratings, modified by FakeSpot (both company and model), and considering 1-star-skew". I'll keep dialing in my calculators over time. Also, every time I see a real complaint / review (Reddit, Discord, etc), I +/-1 the "Sturdy" score for that model / brand.
