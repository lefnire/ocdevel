      <outline text="Tied -ish" _note="Very similar funtionality; just small differences. I don't have a winner (I'm actually putting my money on Phind's future), but I currently use Cursor.&#10;">
        <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://Cursor.sh&quot;&gt;Cursor.sh&lt;/a&gt;">
          <outline text="Pros">
            <outline text="Longer context length (10k tokens) than Cody (7k)" />
            <outline text="Traditionally more up-to-date" _note="Eg, they added gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 almost immediately when it became available, which is important since it one-upped claude-3-opus in code (the current winner till then)&#10;" />
            <outline text="Bring-your-own-model" _note="Settings pane for adding any code model (eg local models), or using your OpenAI / Claude API keys, etc. Very flexible and tinker-y in this way.&#10;" />
          </outline>
          <outline text="Cons">
            <outline text="Daily limits (10 claude-3-opus / day, 500 gpt-4-turbo / month)" _note="Cursor's limits are pretty severe if you ask me&#10;" />
            <outline text="$20/m" />
            <outline text="Standalone editor" _note="Can be a pro or con, but I'd personally have preferred a Jetbrains plugin so I don't have two open IDEs. The pro is they have more control over the IDE, so the magic is more integrated.&#10;" />

        <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://sourcegraph.com/cody&quot;&gt;Sourcegraph Cody&lt;/a&gt;">
          <outline text="Pros">
            <outline text="Unlimited chat (no daily / monthly limits)" _note="This is a big deal. Many of the other plugins have limits, though few as severe as Cursor's. But Cody has no limits, which is wild.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Cheaper ($9/m) than Cursor ($20/m)" />

          <outline text="Cons">
            <outline text="Short context length" />
            <outline text="Crappy Jetbrains plugin" _note="Stick with VSCode, even if you use Jetbrains (like me); just have 2 open editors.&#10;" />

        <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/features/copilot&quot;&gt;Github Copilot&lt;/a&gt;">
          <outline text="Pros">
            <outline text="Smartest, fastest, best IDE integration" _note="Because of this, if/when they ever add full-codebase context, I'll come back to Copilot. Nothing beats it in raw quality.&#10;" />
          </outline>
          <outline text="Cons">
            <outline text="No full-codebase context (RAG / embeddings)! " _note="It works only on the open editor tabs. This is a HUGE shortcoming. The single reason I moved to the other solutions. I believe they added it for enterprise customers? &#10;" />

            <outline text="Context-length: 32k tokens! " />
            <outline text="Additional model (phind-70b)" _note="You can use gpt-4 or claude-3-opus, like the other tools, but you can also use their in-house model which they claim is better sometimes than the other two. Which isn't bogus, since it's fine-tuned specifically on code. So if a certain problem-solving situation isn't working out via gpt-4, you have another LLM to try&#10;">
              <outline text="llama-3 fine-tune might tip the scales" _note="If / when they fine-tune llama-3 for a newer phind-70b, this might make Phind the winner. If fine-tuned llama-2 is already competitive with gpt-4 (for code, specifically); then a newer model might tip the scale.&#10;" />

          <outline text="Cons">
            <outline text="Full-codebase context sucks" _note="The whole reason for not using Github Copilot is for full codebase (RAG / embeddings) context. Phind has this feature in its VSCode extension, but I haven't gotten it to work - it's too buggy.&#10;" />

      <outline text="Disliked: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/&quot;&gt;Jetbrains AI&lt;/a&gt;" _note="It just sucks. It's just so dumb. I think they're using gpt-3.5 for most of the tooling; and context-free GPT-4 for chat. I could be wrong, but I spent way too much time trying to love this (since I'm a Jetbrains user) and I was floored with how bad it was, given their history of incredible products.&#10;" />
