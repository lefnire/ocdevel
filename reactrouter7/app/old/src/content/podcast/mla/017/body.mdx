1. Connect to deployed infrastructure via [Client VPN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/what-is.html)
   * [Terraform example](https://timeular.com/blog/creating-an-aws-client-vpn-with-terraform/)
   * [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uADf-JbN-ZE)
   * [Creating the keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/client-authentication.html#mutual)
