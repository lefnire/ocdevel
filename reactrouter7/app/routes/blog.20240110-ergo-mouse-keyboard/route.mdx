I developed RSI (Repetitive Stress Injury) in my wrist and thumb from overworking. Others develop CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome); they're very similar. This is common in tech workers using a standard mouse; we're not meant for prolonged motion at that pronated angle. This is exacerbated when on a fitness desk (treadmill or stepper), since the back-and-forth / up-and-down motion increases such movement on the wrist. It also develops from squeezing the wrists inward on a standard keyboard, *especially* a compact one (eg laptop). I solved this *definitively* by switching to a trackball mouse and a tented split mechanical keyboard. The fix has been permanent, and RSI only flares up when I'm traveling with a laptop without my ergo peripherals for a long while. Some resort to compression gloves, but that only reduces the pain; it doesn't remove the source, like ergo peripherals do.

### Mouse

<TLDR>[SlimBlade Pro](https://amzn.to/47BxLgJ)</TLDR>

First, let's rule out mice which add ergonomics to the standard layout. These include ergo mice like [Logitech MX Master](https://amzn.to/3NZ24r3); and vertical mice like [Logitech Lift](https://amzn.to/3HcIZxs) or [Logitech MX Vertical](https://amzn.to/3TOKjOO). While an ergonomic grip does reduce (MX Master) or remove (MX Vertical) the pronated angle of the wrist, the motion in the wrist to move the mouse still contributes to RSI. Many will use these mice and feel better; but won't get *all the way* better. I experimented with these for a year (before my deep-dive) and experienced just that. For reference: the "MX" series are their higher quality products; where the non-MXs (eg Lift, M575) are their budget products. In general, I don't recommend Logitech for ergonomics; their products are high quality, but they play it too safe on design, not wanting to dive into niche territory due to the smaller audience. Eg, they don't have finger-ball mice or split keyboards.

The solution is track-balls. Yes, the mice you remember your antisocial gamer uncle using in the 90s. Trust me, these are the solution for RSI / CTS.

First, let's rule out thumb-balls. The next step people often take after a failed experiment with vertical mice, is thumb-ball mice, like [MX Ergo Plus](https://amzn.to/3Hcq3zd) (quality) or [M575](https://amzn.to/3OlJjyf) (budget). They do this (and I did this) because the layout is closer to a standard mouse; just replacing the bottom sensor with a thumb-ball. It's easier to adapt. The problem you quickly face is that moving the thumb that much is as bad on the thumb joints, as moving your pronated hand is on the wrists. Now you face RSI in the thumb. Thumbs aren't meant for that amount of static motion. Nor are they very precise, so users will suffer from reduced effectiveness of mouse-usage. Many swear by these, but those with strong RSI feel the difference easily. I own both listed, and when I use one now for reference, indeed my thumb joints hurt.

Solution: finger-balls. Finger-ball trackball mice have you using your middle or index finger to move a (usually very large, better ergonomics and precision) ball. Therefore, their layouts are much different than you're used to, and they have a learning curve (the reason many don't try). As it goes, the weirder the layout, generally the better the ergonomics (eg [SlimBlade Pro](https://amzn.to/47BxLgJ) being endgame). Now we're talking about the "right" ergo mice, let's compare a few popular options, before we land on my recommended end-game.

- [X-keys L-Trac](https://xkeys.com/l-tracblu.html). This is popular amongst the die-hards. As I understand, the laser sensor and steel bearings are *much* higher quality than sensor & bearings of competitors, making this the precision winner. The bearings don't gather gunk like others do (which requires daily cleaning). There are only three buttons, which is a deal-breaker for me (a programmer who uses middle-click and back frequently). And the design isn't quite as ergonomic as the others.
- ELECOM [Huge](https://amzn.to/48LYA2N) and [Deft Pro](https://amzn.to/3HgaiY4). Two variants of the same concept; the Huge being intended for your battle station where it never moves. The size allows for a larger ball (which improves ergonomics and precision) and comfortable hand-rest. The Deft Pro being smaller is meant for more flexible setups; one-size-fits-all (in case you don't have the desk space, or you may want to travel with it). The ELECOM mice have a layout more familiar to traditionalists, which make them attractive to newcomers. They have two main problems. (1) Their ball bearings are notoriously bad, and most ELECOM die-hards will replace them. This is a maker's task; the bearings aren't meant to just be replaced, you'll spend hours on YouTube. (2) The scroll-wheels are thumb-operated. Per above, too much thumb activity risks RSI, and you scroll more than you realize.
  - I do, however, recommend their little tiny [bitra](https://amzn.to/3SaKF0O) for traveling. It fits into your pocket, and is better ergonomics than a laptop trackpad. having a scroll thumb-wheel, it's not perfect ergonomically (don't use it for your daily driver); but it's handy in a pinch. Don't get the bluetooth version, it's too imprecise. If you don't have a USB-A slot handy for their 2.4ghz version; don't buy it at all.
- Kensington [Orbit Fusion](https://amzn.to/3vu8jg7). Getting closer to proper ergonomics, but still suffers from thumb buttons. Also, the buttons are "squishy" - I find their quality quite low. Surprising, since Kensington's other products are so high-quality.
- Kensington [Expert](https://amzn.to/47uPExU). *Very* popular, and just one step away from end-game. But skip this and go SlimBlade; which is the "new Expert". The only reason I think people still buy this older Kensington, is (1) legacy / outdated recommendations online; (2) it has a physical scroll-wheel, which some prefer to SlimBlade's "virtual" scrolling. Note: the angle on the Expert makes for poor ergonomics, unless you use its wrist cushion. If you're going to get the Expert, just get the Slimbade.

Kensington [SlimBlade Pro](https://amzn.to/3RX6tvA) is the latest iteration of the [SlimBlade](https://amzn.to/3RWvpDo). It has wireless (2.4ghz USB), wired, or bluetooth; it's rare mice offer all 3, so that's a big deal. If you know you want wired-only, you can get the non-pro and save money. But I recommend the Pro, so you can travel easily with it, or use it on a future device you didn't anticipate. The square format takes getting used to, but you'll be glad you did. You'll use all five fingers: middle for ball, and the other four for the 4 buttons as you'd guess. Even though you use your thumb, which I've been dogging, you do so in a downward press rather than back-and-forth motion required by the other mice. Virtually no impact on thumb RSI. And I recommend hovering your hand over the whole device, like [Saruman over the Palantir](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Saruman_uses_the_Palantir.jpg); rather than resting your hand on anything. To scroll, you rotate the ball. As you get used to this you'll find yourself grabbing it full-on and turning it; but you'll slowly progress towards sort of "wiping" your ring finger or middle finger along the edge. Once you're used to the layout, scrolling, and ball - which admittedly takes time - you'll find it difficult to use anything else. And a HUGE benefit of the SlimBlade over the others is it's ambidextrous; meaning you can switch hands. If you do, you'll use [Kensington Works](https://www.kensington.com/software/kensingtonworks/) to map the keys as mirrored. Personally I switched to my left hand to let my right RSI heal up. But by the time it did, I was so used to left-handed SlimBlade that I never went back.

### Keyboard

<TLDR>Quality: [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/), Budget: [Keychron Q11](https://amzn.to/49INDPN)</TLDR>

A properly-ergonomic KB (keyboard) is split and tented. Your arms angled parallel to each other and 90deg, your hands vertical, like a robot holding a box. So the dream KB might look [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/ssn24o/verticalhigh_angle_mounting_experiments_3_styles/); which unfortunately requires modding. So the next best thing is "tented" KBs, meaning angled (via legs or kickstands) as steeply as possible.

First, let's rule out non-split KBs. These are the "vertical mice" of KBs: playing it safe to sell more, but too safe for true benefit. These include [Logitech K860](https://amzn.to/48QlVQS), [Kensington Pro Fit](https://amzn.to/3RW7tzZ), [Microsoft Sculpt](https://amzn.to/3TXILSK), etc. These are indeed better than standard layouts, as (1) they're generally larger, lending to a proper arm position; and (2) they're inward-angled and slight "wave", improving wrist kink. But they're just not the real deal. The closest non-split I've seen to true ergonomics is [Kinesis Advantage2](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/). You can see that huge gap between the sides, and slight tenting by way of the concave keywell. But even that's been succeeded by a true split (Advantage 360, below).

Split KBs are so niche that there's only a handful of purchasable pre-builts. Many split users instead buy DIY home-kits, requiring soldering, keying, firmware, key-mapping, and more. Building a KB can take a week of after-hours time. It's not for most, and it's not for me. If that sounds interesting to you, I'll leave it to you to explore [r/ErgoMechKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/). These include designs like Corne, Iris, Dactyl, Lily58, etc.

Pre-builts: they're just as good, but *much* more expensive. Each has pros / cons, but Glove80 combines all the pros. Some have concave keywells, which improves ergonomics for the knuckles and fingers. Some have thumb-clusters; which allow you to map common keys for improved ergonomics and efficiency. Some remove the Function key row, relying instead on remapped key-combos; which factors into preference (I prefer the standard Functions for Jetbrains). Some have stronger tenting, or no tenting. For the ~$price, I used what my checkout screen shows from my choices (brown switches, tenting, wireless, etc).

- [Dygma Defy](https://dygma.com/products/dygma-defy) ~$480. Successor of the Dygma Raise, this improves on layout and tenting.
  - Pros: Steep tenting. Thumb cluster.
  - Cons: No Function row. Affixed wrist-rest (since I hover-type, the added material makes desk-space and travel harder). No keywell. Expensive.
- [Kinesis Advantage 360](https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#adv360) ~$480. Kinesis has a long history of split keyboards; this model is top quality.
  - Pros: Steep tenting. Thumb cluster. Keywell.
  - Cons: No Functions. Expensive.
- [ZSA](https://www.zsa.io/). Besides Glove80, I consider ZSA products the best catch-all for most users.
  - Voyager (~$365). Pros: tiny, elegant, portable, new. Cons: limited tenting; very few keys (4 thumbs, no Functions, arrows, ESC, Tab, etc).
  - Ergodox EZ (~$300, older). The basics. Pros: thumb cluster, decent tenting. Cons: no keywell, no Functions row.
  - Moonlander (~$365, newer): An Ergodox upgrade, as I understand.
- Budget picks: [Mistel Barocco MD770](https://amzn.to/3V3V93X) ~$150 or [Keychron Q11](https://amzn.to/49INDPN) ~$200. Least compelling on the list, but budget-friendly. I own Mistel; the internet favors Keychron. I tented mine with [kickstands](https://amzn.to/48pzVRX), see [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/10jtaf3/cheap_kick_stands_to_tent_keyboards/).
  - Pros: Cheap. All keys.
  - Cons: No tenting (easy mod). No keywell. No thumb cluster.
- [Glove80](https://www.moergo.com/) ~$370. End-game; where I see most in online discussions settling down.
  - Pros: All keys. Thumb cluster. Keywell. Tenting. Detachable wrist-rest (can be small / portable).
  - Cons: Key layout learning-curve.
