Getting good sleep is fundamental to health, well-being, and cognitive function. Possibly the most important of all health requirements (of exercise, sleep, diet). The hacks:

## Sound Blocking: Sleepbuds

Noise disrupts sleep cycles. Noise-masking/canceling earbuds provide a quiet environment. [SoundCore A20 $150](https://amzn.to/41575oD) (budget) or [Ozlo $300](https://amzn.to/414becq) (premium) are the best. Ozlo is the successor to Bose Sleepbuds II (the latter was discontinued, that team forked into Ozlo). These devices are much smaller than traditional earbuds - so you can sleep on your side comfortably - achieved by focusing on playing masking sound-bites on repeat, rather than streaming via Bluetooth.

## Mindfulness or Reading: The Ultimate Hack
This is the most important, most overlooked, sleep hack. The primary culprit behind sleeplessness for most is rumination â€“ the endless cycle of thoughts, worries, and to-do lists that plague the mind at bedtime. Mindfulness cancels that process.

* The age-old solution, counting sheep, isn't just a silly trope. It's a rudimentary form of mindfulness. By focusing on a repetitive, neutral task, it gently pulls your attention away from racing thoughts.
* Meditation, practiced "in the raw" (without guided audio), is even more effective. It cultivates present moment awareness, training your mind to observe thoughts without getting carried away by them.

The brain science, Default Mode Network (DMN) vs. Task-Positive Network (TPN):
* Default Mode Network (DMN): This network is active when your mind is wandering, engaging in self-referential thought, and ruminating. The DMN is heavily implicated in anxiety, depression, and overthinking. Key regions include the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and angular gyrus.
* Task-Positive Network (TPN): This network is engaged when you're focused on a specific task, whether it's solving a problem, reading, or performing a physical activity. The TPN is associated with attention, executive function, and a sense of calm control. Key regions include the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parts of the parietal lobe.
* Mediation's role: Studies show that meditation is associated with decreased activity in the DMN, and increased activity in the TPN. DMN keeps you up, TPN helps you sleep. Plus, this improves mental wellness with time.

**Reading, a TPN crutch**: Let's be realistic, most people won't consistently meditate or count sheep. Reading activates the same TPN, offering a practical, entertaining (fiction), and edifying (non-fiction) alternative. By engaging your mind in a focused activity, reading pulls you out of the rumination loop of the DMN.

E-Readers are sleep-friendly. Opt for one with front-lighting, like [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/3CP6jTq). Front-lighting illuminates the page from the sides, rather than backlighting (used in phones and tablets), which directly shines light into your eyes. Many e-readers also offer blue-light filtering or "warm light" settings, further minimizing the potential for melatonin suppression.

## Foundation: Non-Negotiables

* Diet: Whole foods, complex carbs, healthy fats. Avoid processed foods, sugar, excess saturated fat.
* Exercise: 30+ minutes most days. Avoid intense workouts near bedtime.
* Eating Window: Last meal 2-3 hours pre-sleep. Facilitates digestion.
* Caffeine: Stop 6-8 hours pre-bedtime. Note hidden sources (chocolate, teas).
* Alcohol: Avoid. While it can induce initial sleep, it will disrupt later sleep.
* Screens: Disconnect 1+ hour pre-bed. Blue light suppresses melatonin.

Supplements:

* Magnesium: Promotes relaxation, muscle function. [Magnesium glycinate](https://amzn.to/3QaqP4e) recommended.
* Melatonin: Regulates sleep-wake cycle. Low doses (0.5-3mg) 30-60 minutes pre-bed. Useful for shift work, jet lag.
