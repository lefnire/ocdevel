@/routes/walk2/route.tsx Got a complex task you. Currently there are two columns here: Star Rating and FakeSpot. The underlying data these use for their values you can see how they're structured in @/routes/walk2/treadmills/columns.tsx , and their calculations in @/routes/walk2/treadmills/calculator.tsx . Eg:
1. `rating` looks like: `[ [ starRating, numberOfRatings ], [5-stars, 4-stars, 3-stars, 2-stars, 1-star] ]`
2. `fakespot` looks like: `[ productGrade, companyGrade ]`

We're gonna take a twist here. I want to display a single rating column in the table. It will be a combination of all these values. I'm gonna need your help on how these are calculated. Here's the scoop:

1. the first part of rating [ starRating, numberOfRatings ] - the star rating should be downplayed if the number of ratings is low. I don't know hte best approach here, but basically if there's 1 review, this starRating shouldn't be as impactful. If there are 1000 reviews, it should be more heavily weighted.
2. the second part of rating, [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] is the distribution of ratings. Eg, what percentage of the ratings are 5-stars, etc. Note that sometimes they're not percentages, so they'll need to be normalized for the calculation. The calculation here is a twist. High 1-star skew is indicative of a product which either has fake reviews, or quality-control issues (ticking timebomb, the 5-stars haven't seen it yet). So the "skew" factor should be converted to a modifier number against the original rating. That is, if it looks like [70, 20, 4, 3, 3] then that's a banger score. But if looks like [90, 0, 0, 0, 10], then it should seriously penalize the rating.
3. Fakespot ratings go like [productRating, companyRating]. These are A, B, C, D, F and should be converted to 10, 8, 6, 3, 1. The companyRating is more important, so should be up-weighted (maybe company=.7, product=.3). FakeSpot tends towards false positives, so don't make this final modifier equal-weighted. Assume "B" if not present.
4. Finally, all these weighting calculations should be combined into a single score. That's what will show up in the cells for the table, and used for sorting.

We'll then remove the FakeSpot column for the table display, since it's wrapped up in the newly-modified Rating column. Just show the modified rating, but a popover on the rating's text will display the values used in the calculation.
