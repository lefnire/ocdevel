    <div>GoPlus, somtimes Superfit (and other names too, I'll edit here as I collect).</div>
    <div>I hate this brand. Very bad quality control / motor blowouts, but very popular online. This peeves me because it poisons the well in budget treadmill space. It's GoPlus & WalkingPad that have people saying "you get what you pay for", but only because they're such known names.</div>
