  notes: () => <div>I strongly discourage WalkingPad. It's the one I see the most complaints about online; severe quality issues like motor burnout. I think it's so popular because they landed strong SEO with the name, being exactly what people search for. Please look at the reviews before considering WalkingPad.</div>
