That's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; intense usage to have lasted this long. Just recently it started to develop creaks and groans, which I believe is due to damage I put on the walking pad from the usage. But I think it has another 6 months left in it before I need to use the extended warranty.&#10;" />

          <outline text="Up to 6mph" _note="I like to walk 3.5mph while working; faster than most walking treadmills allow. I wouldn't recommend using this to run/sprint though, unless you absolutely must (no nearby gym, bad weather, etc). While it's quite durable, I fear my 220lbs landing too hard on the pad would cause cracks.&#10;" />

        <outline text="Cons">
          <outline text="Controller sucks" _note="But can easily be replaced for free. Just deal with it. The first one will have button-presses miss-firing (as in, activating a different button's action). To fix this, buy a compatible controller battery along with the treadmill and replace the one in the controller immediately. I think they just run out while sitting in the warehouse. After 1.5yrs, I nonetheless had to do a hard replacement, which GoYouth did for free via Amazon messaging center. It was easy, came fast, and didn't phase me. This isn't a fluke; you'll see in the reviews many have experienced this scenario. &#10;" />

Forget the Wirecutter pick, they only did it because GoPlus is the most popular Amazon budget mill - it was a grab pick. There are two main models: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3tB1g4H&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vxMSuh&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. They have a &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; more, so visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3S8VDnA&quot;&gt;store page&lt;/a&gt; to compare. Hover over as many models' star-rating widgets as you can. Notice the distribution, that looks like a &quot;C&quot; rather than a stair-case. High 1-stars and 2-stars indicate quality issues. If you have the FakeSpot Chrome Extension, you'll see almost all their models are F and D; meaning the 5-stars are fake. Scan through the reviews, and you'll see countless cases of belt-drift, motor blow-out, and more. It's not just Amazon, I've seen GoPlus complaints on Reddit over the years. Hell, GoPlus doesn't even push specs (max weight, horse power, price, incline, etc). Trust me, if GoPlus caught your eye, get Urevo intead; similar line-up but fewer user-reported issues.&#10;The reason I'm heavy-handed here is that GoPlus was one of first in this space, and &quot;poisoned the well&quot; - gave people the impression that budget mills aren't worth it. Similar to what Samsung Gear VR did in the VR market, if you're familiar. As a budget-mill lover, I want people to experience the real deal and not get a bad taste.&#10;">

          <outline text="Running speed" _note="Doubles as a proper treadmill at 7.5mph, much higher than most of the mills listed (including the quality mills). So if you want the choice between walking desk and actual treadmill, this is a great pick.&#10;" />
