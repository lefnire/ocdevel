      <p>This is the true winner of winners, the last boss, buy it for life. The only reason it's not in my "Premium Pick" above is the price - it's untenable for most people, including myself. But assuming you can afford it...</p>
      <h5>Manually powered</h5>
      <p>There's no motor. You walk up a slope and gravity does the job. This saves on electricity, and makes setting your speed second nature rather than set.</p>
      <h5>Last a Lifetime</h5>
      <p>Because there's no motor, there's little that can go wrong. It's the motor that dies first in treadmills - rarely something else (like deck cracks, etc). Additionally, this is built in Germany by real geeks who care. This isn't an alphabet-soup-named cash-grab on Amazon. They got the tech right.</p>
      <h5>Ergonomics</h5>
      <p>The slight slope offers that needed angle. The ${slats.thera} or ${slats.terrain} offer significant cushioning - like you're walking on foam or forrest moss. Most walk barefoot or with socks (ergonomically bad with other mills). The ${slats.terrain} is good for your feet (applying uneven pressure as you go); though it does add a slight instability, so if you're worried get the ${slats.thera}. Also, research that ${thera} tech. It won't get gross nor flattened with time, which foam would. It's really cool tech</p>
      <h5>Whisper quiet</h5>
      <p>35dB. Most sound comes for motors, so there you go.</p>
      <h5>Global shipping</h5>
      <p>The only treadmill I've found that ships everywhere, rather than the usual suspects. Do note though, it's pricey shipping, and takes 6-8 weeks.</p>
      <h5>Cons</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Price, obviously.</li>
        <li>Height. It's so tall you'll need a specialized desk; or at least peripherals, like monitor arms and a keyboard raiser.</li>
      </ul>

    notes: () => <div>There's no ratings anywhere. It's not on Amazon, and their company page lacks reviews. But I've seen enough via Reddit to know this is a lifetime buy with few flaws. The Walkolution 2 is new. But users of the prior versions tend to be all-day walkers, and I haven't seen a single mentioned hiccup.</div>
