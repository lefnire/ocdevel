export const nonBudgetNote = "These can bear more weight than the budget picks, and can run continuously for much longer. They're quieter, and they'll need less servicing."

export const budgetNote = "For lowest price mills, I recommend DeerRun instead. All the ultra-budget mills last around a year (at 40hrs / week). So if you're just testing the waters, prioritize cost (DeerRun); and if you want more value, upgrade to my mid-tier recommend. For Urevo budget mills, below are best price, no incline (except E3), less durable (but still very good). E3 has incline, but is very old and lacks shock absorption and motor venting. So I recommend E5 with a 2x4 under the head."
