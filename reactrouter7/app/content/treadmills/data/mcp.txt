Split this into separate subtasks:
1. Open @/app/content/treadmills/data/templates/product.tsx. This is the template, ie definition, of each attribute for each treadmill. Pass it to step 3.
2. List all files in @/app/content/treadmills/data ending in .tsx, which aren't named `brand.tsx`, and ignoring the `templates/` folder (which you used in step 1). For each filename you found, pass them to step 3. Do this one file at a time, step 3 should be run one subtask per file (not all at once)
3. This step should receive the template form step 1 (we'll call it <template>), and hte current product data for an individual file (we'll call it <product>). Use a tool to browse the url specified in <product>, from `links.amazon.US`. If that link isn't available, this file's subtask is done. If the link is available, scan that Amazon webpage. Look for any discrepancies between <product> and Amazon. If there are major differences, edit the file. (minor changes would be a dollar difference in price, for example).
