Software and hardware I live and die by. I'll continue to modify this list with time.

#### <FaMicrophone /> Content Creation

**[Descript](/creator).** Audio & video editing studio, which uses AI to improve recording quality, remove filler words and retakes, and more. Proof: I record my [episodes](/mlg) at a walking desk, see if you can hear the treadmill.

#### <FaCode /> Programming

**[Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) (PyCharm).** Packs more punch than VSCode, especially for ML. You can run Jupyter Notebooks in IDE, set debugger breakpoints in cells, and use Junie for code AI within cells. It has EDA & cleansing tools (DataWrangler), sophisticated Git tooling, and more.

**[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/).** Since Jetbrains is playing AI catch-up (Junie), I use Roo Code + Gemini 2.5 Pro for agentic AI coding. Look into Boomerang Mode!

#### <FaLaptop /> Hardware

**[Treadmill desk](/walk)**. Walking improves health, focus, and energy. I walk ~10 miles per day while coding, studying, recording, and editing. That's double the CDC recommendation, so it also saves time and money by nixing the gym.

**[Ergonomic mouse & keyboard](/blog/20240110-ergo-mouse-keyboard)** These reduce RSI (repetitive stress injury) and CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome) for us techies.

**[Gaming & ML laptop](/blog/20240108-ml-gaming-laptop)**. Because machine learning is CUDA-heavy, PC is recommended over Mac. Doubles as a gaming rig! I swear by Legion Pro. Use Windows + WSL2 if you need Windows (gaming, specific software); else, Linux.
