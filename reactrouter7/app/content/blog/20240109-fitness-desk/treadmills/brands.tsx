      Urevo has the best value (price-to-quality ratio) of my research & testing. Eg, compared to Egofit M2 - they're available on Amazon, with extended warranty, cheaper, less sensitive to pet-hair, for otherwise same quality. They're the default choice by some package deals (like FlexiSpot walking desks). I recommend the Urevo 3S for mid-tier, CyberPad for quality. Their other models have some combination of good price, shock absorption, incline, good motor; but rarely all together. Expand other sections to compare. Note: their prices fluctuate, and there's often an Amazon Coupon (right under the price), check before buying.

      <h4>Choosing the right model</h4>
      <div>
        There are multiple options, each with trade-offs. Budget = SpaceWalk E; Mid = SpaceWalk S; Quality = Strol & CyberPad

          <div><small>Their website is easier to compare models than Amazon. Newer models are better, since Urevo iterates fast based on user complains. Eg, the SpaceWalk E3 had motor heat complaints; so they improved that with E4; then again with E5 (adding vents).</small></div>

          <h5>Then copy/paste the model name into Amazon</h5>
          <div><small>Some of the newest models aren't there yet; but most the others are. Then you can get the Asurion extended warranty and all that. They don't name them on Amazon, so cross-reference the image from what you chose on urevo.com.</small></div>
