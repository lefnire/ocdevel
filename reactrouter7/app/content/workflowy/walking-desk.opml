      <outline text="Why walking desk">
        <outline text="Focus" _note="Unlike bikes &amp; steppers, treadmills move &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; (just keep up), and satisfy the mind jitters. It &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; helps with ADHD; one of the only things that works for me (along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240117-pomodoro-thinkers&quot;&gt;Modified Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt;). &#10;" />
        <outline text="Energy" _note="Moving keeps blood and endorphins pumping. It keeps you alert and on task all day. Oxygen and endorphins help not just with energy, but focus. You'll need less caffeine.&#10;" />
        <outline text="Health" _note="Calories and heart-rate. At my best, I've clocked 320 active zone minutes (Fitbit) in a day. That's 5.3 hrs of gym time. Excessive likely - but suffice it eliminates the gym, saving time and money. At my worst, I clock the minimum-recommend 10k steps. Further, your posture is ideal while walking, better than sitting &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; standing.&#10;" />
      </outline>
      <outline text="Treadmills" _note="Choose based on your budget; quality matches cost. From lowest-&amp;gt;highest: &lt;a href=&quot;key://deerrun&quot;&gt;DeerRun&lt;/a&gt; ($150);  &lt;a href=&quot;key://urevo_3s&quot;&gt;Urevo 3S&lt;/a&gt; ($350); &lt;a href=&quot;key://cyberpad&quot;&gt;CyberPad&lt;/a&gt; ($500). &#10;">
        <outline text="Filters #c" _note="If the aforementioned don't suite you, expand this to compare pros / cons to dial your preferences.">
          <outline text="Click some of these based on requirements #picked-by:op #picked-by:public #budget:low #budget:medium #budget:high #incline:yes #shock:yes #hp:2_5+ #weight:high #size:small  #speed:high #speed:low #electric:no #amazon:yes">
            <outline text="Picked-by #picked-by:public #picked-by:op " _note="OP (&quot;original poster&quot;, aka me) or the public. By public I mean, from what I've seen these are popular picks; sometimes not aligning with what I'd personally choose. Eg, GoPlus and WalkingPad are &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;popular; but I consider them terrible picks, based on reviews and Reddit complaints.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Budget #budget:low #budget:medium #budget:high" _note="This is the price-to-quality trade-off. The budget picks (eg Urevo), you'll see I describe as &quot;surprisingly good&quot; - which means relative to the price. If price (and other factors like size, portability) aren't an issue, you might consider more expensive machines like LifeSpan; they'll likely last longer and need less maintenance. If this has you anxious (you want to save money, but you want quality) then click budget:medium, I deem the quality jump to Lifespan a &quot;diminishing returns&quot; scenario.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Incline #incline:yes" _note="Sports medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240228-walking-desks-incline&quot;&gt;recommends a 3% incline&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-budget models lack incline. For Urevo models, the number on the remote / console means % (it's not obvious); so setting it to 3 means 3%. Some models support more than 3, which burns significantly more calories (CyberPad goes to 14, which is 50% more calories). If you're in a rush to lose weight, go for it; but don't make it a life-style, slow-and-steady at 3% wins the race.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Shock Absorption #shock:yes" _note="Some of these mill shave silicon cushions placed under the walking pad (either buffering the floor, or additional machinery) to absorb shock for reduced knee wear. As with an incline of 3%, the more damage control you can do for your knees the better, as you may be using this most of your working life. &#10;" />
            <outline text="HorsePower #hp:2_5+ " _note="While a oversimplistic, it's fairly safe to say that higher horsepower motors tend to last longer. So this is a good litmus of longevity. Anything less than 2HP tends to have poor reviews due to blown-out motors. Treadly, at 1HP, straight up went out of business! 2.25HP tends to be the average for budget treadmills, so I find anything with 2.5HP or more to be above the mark. &#10;" />
            <outline text="Weight #weight:high" _note="How much weight (yourself) can it support. I consider 265lbs high, only because less than that is common enough not to be a filter. &#10;" />
            <outline text="Size #size:small" _note="Xiser is a mini stepper, and so portable you can stuff it in a suitcase and fly. That's one extreme. For the treadmills though, there's quite a range in WxHxL dimensions which could make a difference with (a) how much space you have at your home; (b) how much space is available between the legs of a desk you may already own. Most standard 1-person desks won't fit all the treadmills on this list, so measure the space between your desk legs and look at the product listings' dimensions before purchasing.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Speed #speed:high " _note="Most of the walking pads are intended for walking. But there are a handful which support running as well. Usually this entails raising handlebars for support, and the devices are typically more expensive to withstand the beating. They'll also last longer, since the require stronger motors. Click speed:high if you may want to use this outside of work, for a proper exercise session.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Electric #electric:no " _note="Yes if it plugs into the wall / uses electricity. The benefit is that &quot;it moves you&quot; (you set a speed an keep up), rather than &quot;you move it&quot;. When the machine moves you, there's a lot less mental load to engage the machine while you're working. This is especially a problem with sit-down under-desk mini bikes; the distraction is pretty significant. The distraction is medium with a stepper (Xiser). The distraction is not only gone, but &lt;i&gt;improved&lt;/i&gt;, with an electric treadmill; since the automation of it occupies the jittery part of your brain. If distraction is a big issue for you, you should consider an electric treadmill. The downside, of course, is that it uses electricity, thus money. And requires an available outlet, which maybe your circumstances don't allow. Nor are these devices portable, compared to the Xiser which you can pack into check-in luggage. &#10;" />
            <outline text="Amazon #amazon:yes " _note="Some people prefer to buy on Amazon, because availability and returns are more reliable; and you can buy an extended warranty (usually Asurion). Some of the recommendations aren't available on Amazon, so be sure to click this filter if it's essential for you.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Quietness #quiet:yes" _note="How conducive to meetings and calls is this treadmill. Whispering is 30dB, conversation is 60dB. So it's only conducive if less than 60. I measure these at 2mph, with the decibel meter near the treadmill and near my microphone.&#10;" />
          </outline>
          <outline text="Notes">
            <outline text="Ratings" _note="I personally find 1-star skews to be the best indicator of review-based quality (along with reading those 1-stars). A huge 1-star bar often indicates fake positive reviews, or at least big quality control issues. Also use Fakespot Chrome plugin to see the fakeness score (A-F)." />
            <outline text="Age" _note="Newer devices are better. A great example is the GoPlus; it's the most popular budget treadmill, but I chose against it in my prior review due to limitations in size, speed, and weight capacity. The latest one fixes all that. Clearly they've made enough money from the prior product's popularity to pour into development against its main complaints. So take note of the age in the &quot;specs&quot; sections; and before you buy anything, make sure to go to that company's store page on Amazon, and find the most recent version of the same product, in case my link is for an older version.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Max-weight" _note="If you're 220 or over, look at the max-weight! Most modern mills are fine, but it was a problem previously. If you're under 220, selection doesn't matter; that tends to be the minimum max-weight I see around. Are you exactly 220? Don't do risk it; get the next weight-class up. &#10;" />
            <outline text="Assembly" _note="None of the machines require assembly, so that's awesome. Even with Xiser, it's more &quot;unflattening&quot; it, which takes less than a minute. The standing desks are another story... I hated assembling my Flexispot.&#10;" />
          </outline>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Urevo" _note="Urevo has the best value (price-to-quality ratio) of my research &amp; testing. Eg, compared to Egofit M2 - they're available on Amazon, with extended warranty, cheaper, less sensitive to pet-hair, for otherwise same quality. They're the default choice by some package deals (like FlexiSpot walking desks). I recommend the &lt;i&gt;Urevo 3S &lt;/i&gt;for mid-tier, CyberPad for quality. Their other models have some combination of good price, shock absorption, incline, good motor; but rarely all together. Expand other sections to compare. Note: their prices fluctuate, and there's often an Amazon Coupon (right under the price), check before buying. &#10;">
          <outline text="Choosing the right model #c" _note="There are multiple options, each with trade-offs. Budget = SpaceWalk E; Mid = SpaceWalk S; Quality = Strol &amp; CyberPad&#10;">
            <outline text="1. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2635321&amp;u=4069700&amp;m=159466&amp;urllink=www%2Eurevo%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Funder%2Ddesk%2Dtreadmill%3Fsort%5Fby%3Dcreated%2Ddescending&amp;afftrack=blog&quot;&gt;their website, sort by Date: new-&amp;gt;old&lt;/a&gt;" _note="Their website is easier to compare models than Amazon. Newer models are better, since Urevo iterates fast based on user complains. Eg, the SpaceWalk E3 had motor heat complaints; so they improved that with E4; then again with E5 (adding vents). &#10;" />
            <outline text="2. Find one based on needs" _note="Spacewalks are the budget options; &quot;S&quot; models are the mid-range; and Strols allow running (max speeds around 7.5mph). &#10;" />
            <outline text="3. Then copy/paste the model name into Amazon" _note="Some of the newest models aren't there yet; but most the others are. Then you can get the Asurion extended warranty and all that. They don't name them on Amazon, so cross-reference the image from what you chose on &lt;a href=&quot;https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2635321&amp;u=4069700&amp;m=159466&amp;urllink=www%2Eurevo%2Ecom%2Fcollections%2Funder%2Ddesk%2Dtreadmill%3Fsort%5Fby%3Dcreated%2Ddescending&amp;afftrack=blog&quot;&gt;urevo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&#10;" />

Every so 50 hours or 3 months of use, apply this lube in a zig-zag motion under the belt (between belt and pad). Then run the treadmill at 1mph for 2 minutes without walking on it. This reduces heat build-up on the pad; which heat would be transferred to the motor, which would cause degradation. You'll want one a long syringe, rather than the wobbly tube - those are harder to control.&#10;" />
          <outline text="Adjusting the belt" _note="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcjWc-tjLHA&quot;&gt;How-to video&lt;/a&gt;. If the belt starts to drift one way or another, you take an Alan wrench and tighten &lt;i&gt;the side which is too tight / close (not not the side with slack)&lt;/i&gt;. This pulls the belt away from that too-tight side towards the slack side. Think of it as if you created a slope that the belt rolls down. Do quarter turns clock-wise while the belt is running, wait 15 seconds to see if it fixes itself, and do another quarter turn if not (repeat until it's fixed). Then you just leave it - it's something I don't understand, not &quot;undoing&quot; the tightening after the fix, but whatever - you just leave it. This situation happens say once every week or two, is something you do with all the treadmills; necessary evil.&#10;" />
          <outline text="Get extended warranty if available" _note="Asurion or whatever it is. With the budget treadmills, since YYMV and the reviews are fairly inconsistent, you'll want the peace of mind. I estimate the lifespan of them to be 2 years, based on my own experience.&#10;" />
          <outline text="Walk 30-45 min, break 1-5 min" _note="Budget mills deal less effectively with heat. To deal with this, reduce the amount of at-one-time walking. I recommend 30-45 minutes of walking, and a 1-5 minute break (turn off via remote). The occasional hour or two won't kill these machines; but running the belt for 8hrs a day might. I'm a fan of the Pomodoro Technique for focus management. You work for 25 minutes (don't check emails / texts / Slack, nothing - pure hardcore work) and then take a break for 5 minutes to catch up on everything, or just de-steam. This fits perfectly with the treadmill. Work for 25-30, turn it off and go check your texts in the bathroom or whatever for 5 min, repeat. &#10;" />

        <outline text="Previous research: EgoFit, GoYouth, GoPlus, WalkingPad, LifeSpan #c" _note="I research and test models constantly, so my picks change every 6mo or so. I previously recommended GoYouth, but gained knee pain after 2 years of full-time walking. I found a 3% incline is recommended in sports medicine to mitigate that. So I moved to EgoFit M2 for 3% incline, shock absorption, easy access to under-belt lubing, and a larger weight capacity. Then I found Urevo, which has the same perks and quality, but much cheaper. You can stop here if that's all you care to know; or expand this section to see my previous research, to compare other products you may have heard about. &#10;">
          <outline text="Budget" _note="The budget mills can be more loud, and deal less effectively with heat. To deal with this, reduce the amount of at-one-time walking (eg 30-45 min on, 2-5 min break). Generally expect to get around 2 years out of these mills; compared to the non-budgets which could last a life-time. Personally I take the trade-off; I don't know where I'll be in 2 years, and I also have an extended warranty. You can buy a new budget-mill every 2 years for 12 years before you hit the cost of the non-budgets.&#10;">

After 1.5yrs, I nonetheless had to do a hard replacement, which GoYouth did for free via Amazon messaging center. It was easy, came fast, and didn't phase me. This isn't a fluke; you'll see in the reviews many have experienced this scenario. &#10;" />

Forget the Wirecutter pick, they only did it because GoPlus is the most popular Amazon budget mill - it was a grab pick. There are two main models: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3tB1g4H&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vxMSuh&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. They have a &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; more, so visit their &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3S8VDnA&quot;&gt;store page&lt;/a&gt; to compare. Hover over as many models' star-rating widgets as you can. Notice the distribution, that looks like a &quot;C&quot; rather than a stair-case. High 1-stars and 2-stars indicate quality issues. If you have the FakeSpot Chrome Extension, you'll see almost all their models are F and D; meaning the 5-stars are fake. Scan through the reviews, and you'll see countless cases of belt-drift, motor blow-out, and more. It's not just Amazon, I've seen GoPlus complaints on Reddit over the years. Hell, GoPlus doesn't even push specs (max weight, horse power, price, incline, etc). Trust me, if GoPlus caught your eye, get Urevo intead; similar line-up but fewer user-reported issues.&#10;The reason I'm heavy-handed here is that GoPlus was one of first in this space, and &quot;poisoned the well&quot; - gave people the impression that budget mills aren't worth it. Similar to what Samsung Gear VR did in the VR market, if you're familiar. As a budget-mill lover, I want people to experience the real deal and not get a bad taste.&#10;">

It's still the most durable mini-stepper out there, but this type of motion can be really hard on your knees compared to a treadmill (even without the recommended 3% incline). I've tested 1 week treadmill, 1 week Xiser off and on, and indeed the Xiser really caused strain on my knees over time. Great product, but of no fault of their own - this motion is not good for long term use, especially as a lifestyle (fitness desk). If your requirements exclude a treadmill (you need something whisper-quiet, portable, small, or non-electric), then just make sure to use this less than 4 hours per day. It really is an amazing device.&#10;" />

BTW, don't worry about ESD with treadmills if you use my keyboard/mouse recommends; the touch parts are plastic (even if they're connected via USB), and I've only experienced shock when I touch the laptop directly.&#10;" />

                <outline text="Small / portable" _note="Not only is it small enough to fit under any desk, or within a confined setup; but it's small enough to put into a suitcase and travel with (I've done this over the holidays). It breaks down and folds flat. &#10;" />
                <outline text="Invincible" _note="I know it's cringy I keep using this word, but I've seen others use it; and having validated this, I'm parroting. I've left it in the rain on accident. I've spilled a soft drink in around the pistons. At first it lost resistance and made bad sounds, I could smell the sugar burning; then it just burned it off and went back to normal. When I first assembled it, the head wasn't aligned on the piston correctly; had an &quot;oh shit&quot; moment after days like that, fixed it - never seen any negative effect. It went through check-in ruffage. I've used it for multiple hours at a time without a break (something I wouldn't do with my GoYouth). I don't know why I treat this thing so poorly; likely just because I trust it so much. &#10;" />
                <outline text="Stability" _note="Surprisingly, stepping is a more stable motion for computing than is walking. Walking creates a back and forth motion that you have less control over; where stepping you fully control the motion, and it's up and down. And if you do it right, it's not your whole body going up and down; but just your legs. So you'll have less trouble getting precise mouse-clicks on a stepper than on a treadmill. Though, unless you're going 3.5mph or more on a treadmill, this shouldn't be an issue anyway; just a small point.&#10;">
                  <outline text="Better for gaming" _note="Since precision on mouse and keyboard is essential while gaming, a Xiser is better than a treadmill. The main trade-off is focus; but let's be honest - you won't have difficulty focusing while gaming - that's only a struggle during work. I step more consistently when gaming, since I'm in the zone, so I get a better workout.&#10;" />

              </outline>
              <outline text="Cons">
                <outline text="Hardcore" _note="The easiest setting (you turn a dial) on the Xiser is still the equivalent, I'd guess, of running 5-6mph. There's nothing lower than that. My Fitbit clocks me at 120bpm, and 30 active-zone minutes per 30 stepping minutes. It's a real workout. Note: unlike a treadmill at 6mph, which would be too unstable to work (from the bouncing and keeping up); there's no loss in stability or precision when stepping, since it's all localized motion. So this added physical effort doesn't translate to more difficult computing; it's purely for consideration in what level of physical effort you're willing to exert while working. Think about face-time meetings, whether you want to wear gym clothes while working, etc. I personally do use the Xiser many days of the week (when I have good energy), because my coworkers don't care and I like the exercise. &#10;" />
                <outline text="Mental effort" _note="This is the biggest difference between electric and non-electric machines. Electric machines (like treadmills) &quot;move you&quot;, and you just have to keep up. this actually improves your focus since it gets the jitters out. But machines you manually engage (like the Xiser) require some mental effort to remember to push. I find I still focus better on a Xiser than while standing or sitting; my thinking is the endorphins and blood-flow make up for the loss. But of all the manual machines I've used for fitness desks, Xiser requires the least mental effort, since there's a certain amount of required momentum and consistency to keep the thing going; compared to Sunny Health or under-desk bikes, where the resistance 1-1 tied to the push.&#10;" />

This is the response I got from Xiser support; which when implemented fixed the sound issue. Surprisingly the sounds never returned, so it doesn't seem like a maintenance issue but a fix:&#10;&quot;If a clicking or creaking sound is coming from your machine while in use, it is not damaging your machine.  Most likely, one of the connecting bolts needs a little lubrication.  Use a silicone spray.  One with Teflon is superior.  Do not use WD40.  Spray where the cables connect to the pedals and where the cables connect to the cap that fits on top of the pistons.  You can also lubricate inside the cap before placing it on the piston.  Do not spray the piston or try and manipulate the piston in any way.&quot;&#10;" />

            <outline text="Other steppers and bikes - DON'T DO IT #c" _note="If you don't go with a treadmill, buy the Xiser. Do NOT buy any other stepper or bike. I've owned many steppers, including the most popularly-recommended Sunny Health steppers. None of them have lasted more than a few months. &#10;">
              <outline text="Steppers" _note="They can't handle extended use. Heat builds up in the pistons, and you'll start to hear loud wheezing on each down-push; followed shortly after with a loss of all resistance. It's called &quot;leaky cylinders&quot;, and they don't recover from this - they're toast. I don't know what it is about Xiser, but every review I've read pegs it for durability and extended use. I've used mine for 1.5 years, for hours at a time. I haven't used it as much as the GoYouth, but definitely enough to prove its durability. I've also abused the hell out of it traveling, and the thing just won't break. Plus they have a 5 year warranty (because they're so confident).&#10;" />
              <outline text="Bikes" _note="Under-desk bikes are also very prone to break, I've owned a few of these. More importantly though, by sitting and pedaling, you're manually engaging the bike in a way requiring more mental effort than a standing stepper (which grants some &quot;automation&quot; just in the down push). A standing stepper like Xiser already has the con of mental effort as you have to &quot;move it&quot;, compared to treadmills &quot;moving you&quot; (which removes the mental effort). Under-desk cyclers effectively double that mental effort. So you'll find that when you're thinking about cycling, you'll engage it; but now you're not thinking about work. When you're in the zone working, you'll totally stop cycling. It defeats the purpose. I haven't met someone who's owned an under-desk cycler who used it longer than a week.&#10;" />

But if you want to splurge, browse that subreddit. I have seen Flexispot starting to gain traction there recently; in particular the E7 / E7-Pro. You'll definitely want an electric desk which can sit or stand, because after walking or standing all day, you'll need a break sometimes. &#10;" />

I spent a long time researching the perfect standing setup. Standing on a hard surface for prolonged periods is NOT good for you (even with good shoes); it's better to just sit. So my next move was standing-specific mats. When things really changed was in exploring wobble boards (Yes4All, Fezibo, Gymba, etc). By wobbling, you're exerting a sort of added &quot;cushion&quot; which lets your body alleviate tension here then there. It's less effort, and more comfort, than you'd think. Plus this improves posture, and evidently burns some 200-300 calories extra per 8hr standing day. I went through quite a few of these, but they all suffered from a lack of good angle or weight distribution. Eg, Yes4All is too &quot;ballerina pose&quot;. Fezibo has you over-pronating, which is terrible for your ankles. Revbalance is too hard-core, there's no way you'll focus while surfing. So the end-game was Fluidstance. &#10;&#10;You'll want the cushioned one specifically (PlaneCloud). Prolonged standing is so hard on your feet, that you need all the cushion you can get. The top is cushioned, the wobbling aspect itself provides a pseudo &quot;cushion&quot; (you're sort of floating around), and I recommend &lt;i&gt;also &lt;/i&gt;wearing shoes. Cushion!&#10;&#10;Please note: if you've walked all day, you shouldn't switch to standing; you should sit. Use a standing board for days you don't walk, otherwise sit. Walking and standing put strain on your knees, and to preserve your health you should &lt;i&gt;choose one or the other&lt;/i&gt;; and then sit to recover.&#10;" />

This allows you to position the monitors in a tighter cluster, since you have flexibility to angle them without worry of the base leaning over the edge. It also allows you to pull the monitors closer to your face, just above your mouse and keyboard, in a way you couldn't do with a stand.&#10;" />

This can be a monitor, peripherals which have any metal components, your laptop itself, etc. This can damage the electronics in the components you touched, and your computer (the current sent from the component through the connecting wire). There are two solutions: (1) make sure all the components you touch are plastic (SlimBlade and MD770 are), and never touch anything else (you monitor, laptop, etc) while walking; this is what I do. Or (2) buy an anti-static wristband, clamp it to something grounded, and now you don't have to worry about what you touch.&#10;" />
