## Concepts
- **Performance Evaluation Metrics**: Tools to assess how well a machine learning model performs tasks like spam classification, housing price prediction, etc. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1/F2 scores, and confusion matrices.
- **Accuracy**: The simplest measure of performance, indicating how many predictions were correct out of the total.
- **Precision and Recall**:
  - **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions made by the model (how often your positive predictions were correct).
  - **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to all actual positive examples (how often actual positives were captured).

## Performance Improvement Techniques
- **Regularization**: A technique used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty for larger coefficients in linear models. It helps find a balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting).
- **Hyperparameters and Cross-Validation**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters is crucial for optimal performance. Dividing data into training, validation, and test sets helps in tweaking model parameters. Cross-validation enhances generalization by checking performance consistency across different subsets of the data.

## The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- **High Variance (Overfitting)**: Model captures noise instead of the intended outputs. It's highly flexible but lacks generalization.
- **High Bias (Underfitting)**: Model is too simplistic, not capturing the underlying pattern well enough.
- Regularization helps in balancing bias and variance to improve model generalization.

## Practical Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure data completeness and consistency through normalization and handling missing values.
- **Model Selection**: Use performance evaluation metrics to compare models and select the one that fits the problem best.
