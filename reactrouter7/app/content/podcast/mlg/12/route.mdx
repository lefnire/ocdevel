### Topics

- **Shallow vs. Deep Learning**: Shallow learning can often solve problems more efficiently in time and resources compared to deep learning.

- **Supervised Learning**: Key algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). KNN is unique as it is instance-based and simple, categorizing new data based on proximity to known data points.

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - **Clustering (K Means)**: Differentiates data points into clusters with no predefined labels, essential for discovering data structures without explicit supervision.
  - **Association Rule Learning**: Example includes the a priori algorithm, which deduces the likelihood of item co-occurrence, commonly used in market basket analysis.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Condenses features into simplified forms, maintaining the essence of the data, crucial for managing high-dimensional datasets.

- **Decision Trees**: Utilized for both classification and regression, decision trees offer a visible, understandable model structure. Variants like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees increase performance and reduce overfitting risks.
