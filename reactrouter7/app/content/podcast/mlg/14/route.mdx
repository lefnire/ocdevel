### Anomaly Detection Systems
- **Applications**: Credit card fraud detection and server activity monitoring.
- **Concept**: Identifying outliers on a bell curve.
- **Statistics**: Central role of the Gaussian distribution (normal distribution) in detecting anomalies.
- **Process**: Identifying significant deviations from the mean to detect outliers.

### Recommender Systems
- **Types**:
  - **Content Filtering**: Uses features of items (e.g., Pandoraâ€™s Music Genome Project).
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user behavior and preferences, like "Users Also Liked" model utilized in platforms like Netflix and Amazon.
- **Applications in Machine Learning**: Linear regression applications in recommender systems for predicting user preferences.

### Markov Chains
- **Explanation**: Series of states with probabilities dictating transitions to next states; present state is sufficient for predicting next state (Markov principle).
- **Use Cases**: Often found in reinforcement learning and operations research.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Running simulations to determine the expected value or probable outcomes of Markov processes.
