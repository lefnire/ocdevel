export const teaser = 'Classical natural language processing (NLP) techniques involve a progression from rule-based linguistics approaches to machine learning, and eventually deep learning as state-of-the-art. Despite the prevalence of deep learning in modern NLP, understanding traditional methods like naive Bayes and hidden Markov models offers foundational insights and historical context, especially useful when dealing with smaller data sets or limited compute resources.'
