**Deep NLP Fundamentals**

Deep learning has had a profound impact on natural language processing by introducing models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are specifically adept at handling sequential data. Unlike traditional linear models like linear regression, RNNs can address the complexities of language which appear from its inherent non-linearity and hierarchy. These models are able to learn complex features by combining data in multiple layers, which has revolutionized areas like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

**Neural Networks and Their Use in NLP**

Neural networks can be categorized into regular feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Feedforward networks are used for non-sequential tasks, while RNNs are useful for sequential data processing such as language, where the networkâ€™s hidden layers are connected to enable learning over time steps. This loopy architecture allows RNNs to maintain a form of state or memory, making them effective for tasks where context is crucial. The challenge of mapping these sequences into meaningful output has led to architectures like the encoder-decoder model, which reads entire sequences to produce responses or translations, enhancing the network's ability to learn and remember context across long sequences.

**Word Embeddings and Contextual Representations**

A key challenge in processing natural language using machine learning models is representing words as numbers, as machine learning relies on mathematical operations. Initial representations like one-hot vectors were simple but lacked semantic meaning. To address this, word embeddings such as those generated by the Word2Vec model have been developed. These embeddings place words in a vector space where distance and direction between vectors are meaningful, allowing models to interpret semantic similarities and differences between words. Word2Vec, using neural networks, learns these embeddings by predicting word contexts or vice versa.

**Advanced Architectures and Practical Implications**

RNNs and their more sophisticated versions like LSTM and GRU cells address specific challenges such as the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur during backpropagation through time. These architectures allow for more effective and longer-range dependencies to be learned, vital for handling the nuances of human language. As a result, these models have become dominant in modern NLP, replacing older methods for tasks ranging from part-of-speech tagging to machine translation.

**Further Learning and Resources**

For in-depth learning, resources such as the "Unreasonable Effectiveness of RNNs", Stanford courses on deep NLP by Christopher Manning, and continued education in deep learning can enhance one's understanding of these models. Emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical application will be crucial for mastering the deep learning techniques that are transforming NLP.
