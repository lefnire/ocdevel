Updated! Skip to [00:29:36] for Data Science (new content) if you've already heard this episode.

Hierarchical breakdown: DS(AI(ML)). Data science: any profession dealing with data (including AI & ML). Artificial intelligence is simulated intellectual tasks. Machine Learning is algorithms trained on data to learn patterns to make predictions.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
Oxford Languages: the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

### Machine Learning (ML) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
Oxford Languages: the use and development of computer systems that are able to learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data.

### Data Science (DS) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)
Wikipedia: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains. Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data.

### History
- Greek mythology, Golums
- First attempt: Ramon Lull, 13th century
- Davinci's walking animals
- Descartes, Leibniz
- 1700s-1800s: Statistics & Mathematical decision making
  - Thomas Bayes: reasoning about the probability of events
  - George Boole: logical reasoning / binary algebra
  - Gottlob Frege: Propositional logic
- 1832: Charles Babbage & Ada Byron / Lovelace: designed Analytical Engine (1832), programmable mechanical calculating machines
- 1936: Universal Turing Machine
  - Computing Machinery and Intelligence - explored AI!
- 1946: John von Neumann Universal Computing Machine
- 1943: Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts: cogsci rep of neuron; Frank Rosemblatt uses to create Perceptron (-> neural networks by way of MLP)
- 50s-70s: "AI" coined @Dartmouth workshop 1956 - goal to simulate all aspects of intelligence. John McCarthy, Marvin Minksy, Arthur Samuel, Oliver Selfridge, Ray Solomonoff, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon
  - Newell & Simon: Hueristics -> Logic Theories, General Problem Solver
  - Slefridge: Computer Vision
  - NLP
  - Stanford Research Institute: Shakey
  - Feigenbaum: Expert systems
  - GOFAI / symbolism: operations research / management science; logic-based; knowledge-based / expert systems
- 70s: Lighthill report (James Lighthill), big promises -> AI Winter
- 90s: Data, Computation, Practical Application -> AI back (90s)
  - Connectionism optimizations: Geoffrey Hinton: 2006, optimized back propagation
- Bloomberg, 2015 was whopper for AI in industry
- AlphaGo & DeepMind
