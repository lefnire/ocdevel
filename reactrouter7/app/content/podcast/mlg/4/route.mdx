### The AI Hierarchy
- Artificial Intelligence is divided into subfields such as reasoning, planning, and learning.
- Machine Learning is the learning subfield of AI.
- Machine learning consists of three phases:
  1. **Predict (Infer)**
  2. **Error (Loss)**
  3. **Train (Learn)**

### Core Intuition
- An algorithm makes a prediction.
- An error function evaluates how wrong the prediction was.
- The model adjusts its internal weights (training) to improve.

### Example: House Price Prediction
- Input: Spreadsheet with features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, distance to downtown.
- Output: Predicted price.
- The algorithm iterates over data, learns patterns, and creates a model.
- A **model** = algorithm + learned weights.
- **Features** = individual columns used for prediction.
- **Weights** = coefficients applied to each feature.
- The process mimics algebra: rows = equations, entire spreadsheet = matrix.
- Training adjusts weights to minimize error.

### Feature Types
- **Numerical**: e.g., number of bedrooms.
- **Nominal (Categorical)**: e.g., yes/no for downtown location.
- Feature engineering can involve transforming raw inputs into more usable formats.

### Linear Algebra Connection
- Machine learning uses linear algebra to process data matrices.
- Each row is an equation; training solves for best-fit weights across the matrix.

## Categories of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- Algorithm is explicitly trained with labeled data (e.g., price of a house).
- Examples:
  - **Regression** (predicting a number): linear regression
  - **Classification** (predicting a label): logistic regression

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- No labels are given; the algorithm finds structure in the data.
- Common task: **clustering** (e.g., user segmentation for ads).
- Learns patterns without predefined classes.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- Agent takes actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
- Example: mouse in a maze trying to find cheese.
- Includes rewards (+points for cheese) and penalties (–points for failure or time).
- Learns policies for optimal behavior.
- Algorithms: Deep Q-Networks, policy optimization.
- Used in games, robotics, and real-time decision systems.

## Terminology Recap
- **Algorithm**: Code that defines a learning strategy (e.g., linear regression).
- **Model**: Algorithm + learned weights (trained state).
- **Features**: Input variables (columns).
- **Weights**: Coefficients learned for each feature.
- **Matrix**: Tabular representation of input data.

## Learning Path and Structure
- Machine learning is a subfield of AI.
- Machine learning itself splits into:
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
- Each category includes multiple algorithms.
