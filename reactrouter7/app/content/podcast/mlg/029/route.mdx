- RL definition: goal, rewards, actions
** Games (Atari, Chess, Go - Lee Sedol & Alpha Go)
** AI: learning, vision / speech, action / motion, planning
** Reasoning / knowledge vs model-based Deep RL?
** Reasoning / knowledge rep (+memory?) => Differential computers (https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/)
** vs supervised. Vision = supervised. Games = action. Trading can go both ways!
** Time: Credit assignment, delayed rewards, investment
- Model-based v free
** Policy (what you do; gut reaction)
- Value-based (Q-learning) vs Policy Gradient
** PG is direct: ML -> action
** Value-based indirect: Bellman stuff -> state/action values (Q-values) -> policy
