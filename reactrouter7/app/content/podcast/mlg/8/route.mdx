Come back here after you've finished Ng's course; or learn these resources in tandem with ML (say 1 day a week).

## Mathematics in Machine Learning
- **Linear Algebra**: Essential for matrix operations; analogous to chopping vegetables in cooking. Every step of ML processes utilizes linear algebra.
- **Statistics**: The hardest part, akin to the cookbook; supplies algorithms for prediction and error functions.
- **Calculus**: Used in the learning phase (gradient descent), similar to baking; it determines the necessary adjustments via optimization.

## Learning Approach
- **Recommendation**: Learn the basics of machine learning first, then dive into necessary mathematical concepts to prevent burnout and improve appreciation.

## Mathematical Resources
- **MOOCs**: Khan Academy - Offers Calculus, Statistics, and Linear Algebra courses.
- **Textbooks**: Commonly recommended books for learning calculus, statistics, and linear algebra.
- **Primers**: Short PDFs covering essential concepts.

## Additional Resource
- **The Great Courses**: Offers comprehensive video series on calculus and statistics. Best used as audio for supplementing primary learning. Look out for "Mathematical Decision Making."

## Python and Linear Algebra
- Tensor: General term for any dimension list; TensorFlow from Google utilizes tensors for operations.
- Efficient computation using `SimD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)` for vectorized operations.

## Optimization in Machine Learning
- Gradient descent used for minimizing loss function, known as convex optimization. Recognize keywords like optimization in calculus context.
