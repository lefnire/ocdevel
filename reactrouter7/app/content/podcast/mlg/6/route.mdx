### Pursuing Machine Learning:
- Individuals may engage with machine learning for self-education, as a hobby, or to enter the industry professionally.
- Use a combination of resources, including podcasts, online courses, and textbooks, for a comprehensive self-learning plan.

### Online Courses (MOOCs):
- MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, offer accessible education.
- Key platforms: Coursera and Udacity. Coursera is noted for standalone courses; Udacity offers structured nanodegrees.
- Udacity nanodegrees include video content, mentoring, projects, and peer interaction, priced at $200/month.

### Industry Recognition:
- Udacity nanodegrees are currently not widely recognized or respected by employers.
- Emphasize building a robust portfolio of independent projects to augment qualifications in the field.

### Advanced Degrees:
- **Master’s Degrees:**
- Valued by employers, provide an edge in job applications.
- Example: Georgia Tech's [OMSCS](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) (Online Master’s of Science in Computer Science) offers a cost-effective ($7,000) online master’s program.
- **PhD Programs:**
- Embark on a PhD for in-depth research in AI rather than industry entry. Program usually pays around $30,000/year.
- Compare industry roles (higher pay, practical applications) vs. academic research (lower pay, exploration of fundamental questions).

### Career Path Decisions:
- Prioritize building a substantial portfolio of projects to bypass formal degree requirements and break into industry positions.
- Consider enriching your qualifications with a master's degree, or eventually pursue a PhD if deeply interested in pioneering AI research.
