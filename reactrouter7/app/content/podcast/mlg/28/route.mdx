More hyperparameters for optimizing neural networks. A focus on regularization, optimizers, feature scaling, and hyperparameter search methods.

### Hyperparameter Search Techniques
- **Grid Search** involves testing all possible permutations of hyperparameters, but is computationally exhaustive and suited for simpler, less time-consuming models.
- **Random Search** selects random combinations of hyperparameters, potentially saving time while potentially missing the optimal solution.
- **Bayesian Optimization** employs machine learning to continuously update and hone in on efficient hyperparameter combinations, avoiding the exhaustive or random nature of grid and random searches.

### Regularization in Neural Networks
- **L1 and L2 Regularization** penalize certain parameter configurations to prevent model overfitting; often smoothing overfitted parameters.
- **Dropout** randomly deactivates neurons during training to ensure the model doesnâ€™t over-rely on specific neurons, fostering better generalization.

### Optimizers
- **Optimizers** like Adam, which combines elements of momentum and adaptive learning rates, are explained as vital tools for refining the learning process of neural networks.
- **Adam**, being the most sophisticated and commonly used optimizer, improves upon simpler techniques like momentum by incorporating more advanced adaptative features.

### Initializers
- The importance of weight initialization is underscored with methods like **uniform random initialization** and the more advanced **Xavier initialization** to prevent neural networks from starting in 'stuck' states.

### Feature Scaling
- Different scaling methods such as **standardization** and **normalization** are used to scale feature inputs to small, standardized ranges.
- **Batch Normalization** is highlighted, integrating scaling directly into the network to prevent issues like exploding and vanishing gradients through the normalization of layer outputs.
