### Hardware
Desktop if you're stationary, as you'll get the best performance bang-for-buck and improved longevity; laptop if you're mobile.

Desktops. Build your own PC, better value than pre-built. See [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), make sure to use an Nvidia graphics card. Generally shoot for 2nd-best of CPUs/GPUs. Eg, RTX 4070 currently (2024-01); better value-to-price than 4080+.   

For laptops, see [this post (updated)](/blog/20240108-ml-gaming-laptop). 

### OS / Software

Use Windows (dev channel), WSL2, and Docker + nvidia-docker. See [mla/12](/mlg/mla-12) for details.

### Programming Tech Stack
Deep-learning frameworks. You'll use both TF & PT eventually, so don't get hung up. [mlg/9](/mlg/9) for details.
1. Tensorflow (and/or Keras)
1. PyTorch (and/or Lightning)

Shallow-learning / utilities: ScikitLearn, Pandas, Numpy

Cloud-hosting: AWS / GCP / Azure. [mla/13](/mlg/mla-13) for details.
