## Key Concepts

- **Machine Learning Hierarchy**: Explains the breakdown into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning with an emphasis on supervised learning, which includes classification and regression.
- **Supervised Learning**: Divided into classifiers and regressors, with this episode focusing on linear regression as an introduction to regressor algorithms.
- **Linear Regression**: A basic supervised algorithm used for estimating continuous numeric outputs, such as predicting housing prices.

## Process of Linear Regression

1. **Prediction**: Using a hypothesis function, predictions are made based on input features.
2. **Evaluation**: Implements a cost function, "mean squared error," to measure prediction accuracy.
3. **Learning**: Employs gradient descent, which uses calculus to adjust and minimize error by updating weights and biases.

## Concepts Explored

- **Univariate vs. Multivariate Linear Regression**: Focus on a single predictive feature versus multiple features, respectively.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization technique that iteratively updates parameters to minimize the cost function.
- **Bias Parameter**: Represents an average outcome in absence of specific feature information.
- **Mean Squared Error**: Common cost function used to quantify the error in predictions.

## Resources

- **Andrew Ng's Coursera Course**: A highly recommended resource for comprehensive and practical learning in machine learning. Course covers numerous foundational topics, including linear regression and more advanced techniques.

Access to **Andrew Ng's Course** on Coursera is encouraged to gain in-depth understanding and application skills in machine learning.
