### Neural Network Types in NLP

- **Vanilla Neural Networks (Feedforward Networks)**:
  - Used for general classification or regression tasks.
  - Examples include predicting housing costs or classifying images as cat, dog, or tree.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**:
  - Primarily used for image-related tasks.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**:
  - Used for sequence-based tasks such as weather predictions, stock market predictions, and natural language processing.
  - Differ from feedforward networks as they loop back onto previous steps to handle sequences over time.

### Key Concepts and Applications

- **Supervised vs Reinforcement Learning**:
  - Supervised learning involves training models using labeled data to learn patterns and create labels autonomously.
  - Reinforcement learning focuses on learning actions to maximize a reward function over time, suitable for tasks like gaming AI but less so for tasks like NLP.

- **Encoder-Decoder Models**:
  - These models process entire input sequences before producing output, crucial for tasks like machine translation, where full context is needed before output generation.
  - Transforms sequences to a vector space (encoding) and reconstructs it to another sequence (decoding).

- **Gradient Problems & Solutions**:
  - **Vanishing and Exploding Gradient Problems** occur during training due to backpropagation over time steps, causing information loss or overflow, notably in longer sequences.
  - **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cells** solve these by allowing RNNs to retain important information over longer time sequences, effectively mitigating gradient issues.

### LSTM Functionality

- An **LSTM cell** replaces traditional neurons in an RNN with complex machinery that regulates information flow.
- Components within an LSTM cell:
  - **Forget Gate**: Decides which information to discard from the cell state.
  - **Input Gate**: Determines which information to update.
  - **Output Gate**: Controls the output from the cell.
