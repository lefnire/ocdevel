  body: String.raw`
1. Understand dailies vs habits. Dailies have a daily quota which must be met; habits can happen or not any number of times per day.
1. Use an off-site todo app. I recommend Workflowy. Have a daily called "todo", time 30m of tackling the off-site todos.
1. USE CUSTOM REWARDS! That's the whole point of the program: pain for gain.
1. Respect the colors. Focus on the reds; relax on the greens & blues. Try to avoid perfect days.
