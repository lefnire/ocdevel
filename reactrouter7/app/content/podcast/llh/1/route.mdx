Over the years of developing productivity apps, making off-topic life-hack suggestions in MLG, etc; I decided to make a podcast dedicated to all my weird tips and tricks for improved productivity and efficiency in your life. Things like treadmill desks for work and study; healthy food for busy people; how to get to sleep faster, etc. Much of these lessons come from developing Habitica (a life-hack of its own), and knowing its community (with their great insights).`
