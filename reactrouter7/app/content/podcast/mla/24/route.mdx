#### Tool Use in AI Code Agents
- **File Operations**: Agents can read, edit, and search files using sophisticated regular expressions.
- **Executable Commands**: They can recommend and perform installations like `pip` or `npm` installs, with user approval.
- **Browser Integration**: Allows agents to perform actions and verify outcomes through browser interactions.

#### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Standardization**: MCP was created by Anthropic to standardize how AI tools and agents communicate with each other and with external tools.
- **Implementation**:
  - **MCP Client**: Converts AI agent requests into structured commands.
  - **MCP Server**: Executes commands and sends structured responses back to the client.
- **Local and Cloud Frameworks**:
  - **Local (S-T-D-I-O MCP)**: Examples include utilizing Playwright for local browser automation and connecting to local databases like Postgres.
  - **Cloud (SSE MCP)**: SaaS providers offer cloud-hosted MCPs to enhance external integrations.

#### Expanding AI Capabilities with MCP Servers
- **Directories**: Various directories exist listing MCP servers for diverse functions beyond programming. [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Automation Beyond Coding**: Implementing MCPs that extend automation into non-programming tasks like sales, marketing, or personal project management.
  - **Creative Solutions**: Encourages innovation in automating routine tasks by integrating diverse MCP functionalities.

#### AI Tools in Machine Learning
- **Automating ML Process**:
  - **Auto ML and Feature Engineering**: AI tools assist in transforming raw data, optimizing hyperparameters, and inventing new ML solutions.
  - **Pipeline Construction and Deployment**: Facilitates the use of infrastructure as code for deploying ML models efficiently.
- **Active Experimentation**:
  - **Jupyter Integration Challenges**: While integrations are possible, they often lag and may not support the latest models.
  - **Practical Strategies**: Suggests alternating between Jupyter and traditional Python files to maximize tool efficiency.
- **Action Plan for ML Engineers**:
  - Setup structured folders and documentation to leverage AI tools effectively.
  - Encourage systematic exploration of MCPs to enhance both direct programming tasks and associated workflows.
