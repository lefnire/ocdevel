  body: `
Machine Learning Guide & Machine Learning Applied are returning, and will use a community project [Gnothi](https://gnothiai.com) for talking points. Code on [Github](https://github.com/lefnire/gnothi). I have new content, especially about NLP. Most will go to [MLA](https://www.patreon.com/machinelearningguide), since much of these talking points are application rather than theory. To get free access to MLA:

1. 3 months free:  post about Gnothi on social media (the link & some info), then [email me](mailto:tylerrenelle@gmail.com) a link or screenshot.
1. Free for life: contribute to [Gnothi's codebase](https://github.com/lefnire/gnothi). Needs to be a decent commit, not single-letter typos.
