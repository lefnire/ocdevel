Inspirations for AI
- economic automation
- singularity
- consciousness

Definitinitions
- cogsci: neuroscience, neuro-x(biology, physiology, computational __, etc), psychology, philosophy, AI
  - computational neuroscience => perceptron
  - frank rosenblatt, warren McCulloche, walter pitts - all brain guys (neurobiology, neurophysiology, computational neuroscience respectively)
- intelligence (computation) vs consciousness (soul); intelligence in scale (animals); brain in scale; consciousness in scale?
- perception, self-identity, memory, attention; (self reflection is just a human-special component)
- awereness (qualia / sentience / subjective experience); modified by attention? (driving, dreams, coma)
- missing: emotions; just built-in goal reinforcemer. plus we don't know how machines experience reinforcement (floor-is-lava)

Hard vs soft problem
  - soft problem = neuroscience
  - hard problem = philosophy
    - dualism: pineal gland, issue with physical->metaphysical; society of mind / connected intelligences
    - maybe definitively non-science, since subjective
    - maybe matter of time; phil is pre-science at each juncture; science turns magic => known (sickness). Either hard problem is unscientific (phil) or around the corner

Emergence (emergent property)

Computational theory of mind
- intelligence & consciousness connected / same
- think: word2vec = understanding? 
- consciousness in scale; does this mean every layer has its own consciousness? Panpsychism. I don't know - just concerned with that which does exhibit intelligence
- integrated information theory
- freewill; conscious / awareness center activated after decision made; all the information in place before whole ; westworld

Biological plausibility
- planes, brains
- sans bio-plaus, functionalism; zombies; turing test; searle's chinese room`
