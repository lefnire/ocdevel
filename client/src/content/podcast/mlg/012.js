Which algo to use?
- [Pros/cons table for algos](https://blog.recast.ai/machine-learning-algorithms/2/)
- [Decision tree of algos](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/)

KNN (supervised)

Unsupervised
- Clustering -> K-Means
- Association rule learning / Market basket -> Apriori
- Dimensionality Reduction -> PCA

Decision Trees (supervised, classify/regress)
- Random Forests
- Gradient Boost`}
