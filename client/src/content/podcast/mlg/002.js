What is AI?
- Simulate any intellectual task
- Goals
  - Search / planning (eg chess)
  - Reasoning / knowledge representation (eg Watson on Jeopardy)
  - Perception
  - Ability to move and manipulate objects
  - Natural language processing (communication)
  - Learning
- Applications
  - Autonomous vehicles (drones, self-driving cars)
  - Medical diagnosis
  - Creating art (such as poetry)
  - Proving mathematical theorems
  - Playing games (such as Chess or Go)
  - Search engines
  - Online assistants (such as Siri)
  - Image recognition in photographs
  - Spam filtering
  - Prediction of judicial decisions
  - Targeting online advertisements 
- When a technique -> mainstream, no longer AI: "AI effect"
  - Pre-programming
  - Weak AI vs Strong / AGI

What is ML?
- Pattern / Predict / Learn
- Versus AI
  - The "whole" (robotics, planning, etc)
  - Professional: ML more interesting, subsuming other fields; ML is starter
  - Conversation
    "AI when wow-ing or colloquial, ML when being professional. Like "coding" vs "software engineering""
- Versus Stats
- Versus DataScience: professionally; ansense vs analytics

History
- Greek mythology, Golums
- First attempt: Ramon Lull, 13th century
- Davinci's walking animals
- Descartes, Leibniz
- 1700s-1800s: Statistics & Mathematical decision making
  - Thomas Bayes: reasoning about the probability of events
  - George Boole: logical reasoning / binary algebra
  - Gottlob Frege: Propositional logic 
- 1832: Charles Babbage & Ada Byron / Lovelace: designed Analytical Engine (1832), programmable mechanical calculating machines
- 1936: Universal Turing Machine
  - Computing Machinery and Intelligence - explored AI!
- 1946: John von Neumann Universal Computing Machine
- 1943: Warren McCulloch & Walter Pitts: cogsci rep of neuron; Frank Rosemblatt uses to create Perceptron (-> neural networks by way of MLP)
- 50s-70s: "AI" coined @Dartmouth workshop 1956 - goal to simulate all aspects of intelligence. John McCarthy, Marvin Minksy, Arthur Samuel, Oliver Selfridge, Ray Solomonoff, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon
  - Newell & Simon: Hueristics -> Logic Theories, General Problem Solver
  - Slefridge: Computer Vision
  - NLP
  - Stanford Research Institute: Shakey
  - Feigenbaum: Expert systems
  - GOFAI / symbolism: operations research / management science; logic-based; knowledge-based / expert systems
- 70s: Lighthill report (James Lighthill), big promises -> AI Winter
- 90s: Data, Computation, Practical Application -> AI back (90s)
  - Connectionism optimizations: Geoffrey Hinton: 2006, optimized back propagation
- Bloomberg, 2015 was whopper for AI in industry
- AlphaGo & DeepMind
