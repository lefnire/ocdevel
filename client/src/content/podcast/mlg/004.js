  body: `
Learning (ML)
- 3-step process
  - Infer / Predict
  - Error / Loss
  - Train / Learn
- First as batch from spreadsheet, then "online" going forward
  - Pre-train your "model"
  - "Examples"
  - "Weights"
- Housing cost example
  - "Features"
  - Infer cost based on num_rooms, sq_foot, etc
  - Error / Loss function 

Categories
- Supervised learning
  - Vision (CNN)
  - Speech (RNN)
- Unsupervised
  - Market segmentation
- Reinforcement & Semi-Supervised
  - Planning (DQN): Games (chess, Mario); Robot movement`
