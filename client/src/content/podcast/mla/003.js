  teaser: "Comparison of different data storage options when working with your ML models. You'll ingest your dataset (CSV, TSV, JSON API, ..) via Pandas. Then you munge the data / Pandas, convert to Numpy & send to your model. Model saves intermediate steps as Numpy->HDF. Publish results of your model's predictions (whether for use in app/website, or for researchers, etc) in a SQL database or CSV."
