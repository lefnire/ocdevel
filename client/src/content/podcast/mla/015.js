Increasingly, higher degrees are important: Masters at a minimum. But you _can_ get by with a Bachelors, I did, it just won't be easy. Either way, it's important to have hands-on experience or a portfolio to show. Some options:
1. Compete in a [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) competition. This can result in prize money, and often direct employment. Those are incredible perks! But even if you don't win or get money / jobs, employers absolutely _love_ Kaggle experience on your resume. Take this very seriously.
1. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/). Start a few side projects, anything that interests you, even if they're small / one-off experiments. Going forward, try to keep all your ML playing-around on public Github repos, rather than folders on your desktop you delete months later - every ounce of code counts.
1. Contribute to an open source ML repo. If you contribute to [Gnothi](http://github.com/lefnire/gnothi), I'll personally vouch for you as a employer reference. Benefits of contributing to high-profile repos is that your contributions are higher-profile (stand out more on your Github page); and you don't have to (a) come up with a project idea; (b) finish/maintain the project; (c) handle the details (like cloud-hosting, authentication, etc).

Finding jobs:
* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) is your bread-and-butter. Make a solid profile, keep up with it.
* [Indeed](https://indeed.com)
* [My old list](/blog/0b06cd49-a9d7-4c0a-8390-950a58e8da95). Outdated, but there should be some timeless gems there. I'll update soon.
