# Budget & non-budget fitness desk setup

I've spent the past 2 years researching and tinkering with my fitness desk setup. My goal was 70% active (walking, stepping, etc); 20% standing comfortably; 10% sitting. I got it dialed after trial and error. I think I've nailed a good breakdown for most people based on if/else. I'll use affiliate links where I can, normal links otherwise (affiliate doesn't factor into my decisions; it's just "might as well").

## Treadmill / Stepper

Tiny summary:
- GoYouth - Budget, but surprisingly good. Pros: small, $350, surprisingly durable. Cons: inconsistent reviews (YMMV).
- Lifespan TR1200 - Quality, expensive. Pros: quality. Cons: expensive, big. 
- Xiser - mini-stepper. Compact, invincible. But hardcore.

Medium summary:
- GoYouth. Inexpensive at $350, but has withstood my major abuse. Smaller than many, so fits well under most desks. Buy the warranty, just in case.
- Lifespan. Tried-and-true (along with iMover, which I'll cover). Used institutionally. Very high quality, but expensive.
- Xiser. A mini-stepper rather than a treadmill. If it weren't so hardcore (the easiest setting makes you sweat heavily), this would be the easy winner, since it's tiny and portable; requires no electricity; and is unbreakable.

#### Budget treadmills. GoYouth (and GoPlus, <fixme:Walkpad>, <fixme:the other like walkingpad>, Uever)

I wanted to start cheap, and upgrade if I proved to myself I wasn't delusional on the 70/20/10 idea. So the main budget contenders were these guys. I spent weeks looking at the reviews through FakeSpot, assessing the skew (giant 1-star bars complaining about breakdowns), and determining the level to which blog posts seemed like paid ads (subjective, but I think I have an eye). The big battle was really between GoPlus and GoYouth; and most end up going with GoPlus, but that 1-star bar really had me concerned. If you read through the 1-stars on GoYouth vs GoPlus, you'll see GoPlus has more core quality complains vs other issues (like the controller issues, which I'll discuss). GoPlus is also larger and harder to fit under all desks. I encourage you to measure the space between your desk legs to rule out some options; you'll be surprsed how wide some of these are. And GoYouth goes over 2.5mph (9mph). While I wouldn't run on it (it doesn't feel durable enough for sprinting), I usually walk 3.5mph. It took me a year to get steady at that speed; you'll want the option.

<fixme:Walkingpad> and <fixme:Other> seemed like great middle-of-the-road options, especially <fixme:walkingpad>. What had me pause is the reviews were through their website or blog posts, and the blogs felt paid to me; and on-website reviews can be doctored. Maybe I'm paranoid, but something just felt off. I'd stumble upon the occasional Reddit post of someone complaining about quality issues. However, I very much would like to try <fixme:walkingpad>, and I encourage you to explore it a bit. <fixme:other> allows you to fold it up.

<fixme:Uevr> is another popular budget. It has a permanent incline; takes up less length, but more height. The reason I didnt' pick it is the weight capacity, and height. I'm 220lbs and need the extra wiggle room.

My experience: <todo

#### Quality treadmills. Lifespan (and iMovr)

#### Steppers

- Pros
  - No electricity
  - Small and portable
- Cons
  - More distracting than treadmills. 
  - (non-Xiser cons): terrible quality. Break fast.
  - (Xiser cons): too hard-core. 

## Ergonomic (keyboard, mouse)

This seems like a weird addition, but you'll find that as you're moving a lot, the motion of your arms (shoulders & wrists especially) create the same negative joint environment that ergonomic-buffs are trying to solve in mouse-usage on your wrist while seated. It's called RSI (repetetive stress injury), and it's bad enough seated using a mouse; it's exacerbated while huffing and puffing. It could take some months, but you're likely to start to experience pain in your wrists, thumbs, ever. The right keyboard & mouse has totally fixed this for me, and I'll never go back even while not exercising.
