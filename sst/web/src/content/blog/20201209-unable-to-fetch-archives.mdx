If you get this error `E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?` at a `apt-get` step of your Dockerfile, try adding `apt-get update` above that step.

Most public Dockerfiles which you'll be inheriting from add `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists` after their `apt-get install` steps. This is to save space, we want our Docker images to be as minimal as possible. I don't know how much space it actually saves, but apt-get will cache install files in case you need to re-install quickly. When `/var/lib/apt/lists` is removed, there's some indexing that goes wacky and apt-get gets confused. You can easily reset it back to normal via `apt-get update` before attempting any installs. Don't listen to its `--fix-missing` advice: that won't fix your problem, just do an `apt-get update`.

So your Dockerfile might look like this:
```
FROM nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu18.04
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y wget && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists  # follow their lead, create small/clean images
```
