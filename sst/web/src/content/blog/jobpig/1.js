let teaser = <p>There are hundreds, if not thousands, of online job boards - and many (most?) for tech. They vary in quality (by which I mean serious, well-paying employers). In this post I'll cover the best boards from my experience. I'll edit this post periodically, and eventually take comments so people can recommend their favorites / correct me.</p>;

  <p>First, if you haven't read <Link to="/blog/21204489-34a6-4d56-8299-0e6d3f446d53">Find Tech Jobs</Link> yet, do so. You wanna try in-person networking first (if you can) and setup a strong LinkedIn profile. Then return here.</p>
  <h4>General</h4>
  <h5>The Good</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>{l('Github Jobs', 'https://jobs.github.com/')}</li>
    <li>{l('Stack Overflow Jobs', 'https://stackoverflow.com/jobs')}</li>
    <li>{l('AngelList', 'https://angel.co/')}</li>
    <li>{l('Dice', 'http://www.dice.com/')}</li>
    {/*<li>{l('Jobpig', 'https://jobpigapp.com/')}</li>*/}
  </ul>
  <p>My personal favorites. I've found fantastic-quality gigs from these boards. Their search functions are fine-grained and tech-geared. Employers who post here are hip and with the latest technology trends. Well-funded startups and the like.</p>
  <h4>The "OK"</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>{l('Indeed','https://indeed.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('SimplyHired','https://simplyhired.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('LinkedIn','https://linkedin.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('Monster','http://www.monster.com/')}</li>
    <li>{l('CareerBuilder','https://careerbuilder.com')}</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everyone knows Monster & Indeed - those are the heavy-hitters. But these are general boards, not tech-geared. Their search functions are cruder than the previous list which let you filter - or at least shows you - skills, salary, equity, etc. Their tech postings tend to be by large "legacy" companies. YMMV, definitely give them a shot - you may have a different experience.</p>
  <h4>Remote</h4>
  <p>If you're looking for remote work - contract / freelance / digital nomad; or full-time remote W2 - here are tips.</p>
  <h4>The Good</h4>
  <p>Firstly, see {l('NoDesk', 'http://nodesk.co/')} and {l('Awesome Remote Job', 'https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job/')} - curated resources for remote workers, and lists of remote job boards.</p>

    {/*

    */}

  <ul>
    <li>See <em>General > The Good</em> from above - these double as quality remote-work sites. The jobs indicate whether they're remote-friendly.</li>
    <li>{l('Authentic Jobs', 'https://authenticjobs.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('Behance','https://www.behance.net/joblist')} (for designers)</li>
    <li>{l('Dribbble','https://dribbble.com/jobs')} (for designers)</li>
    <li>{l('Front-end Developer Jobs', 'http://frontenddeveloperjob.com/')}</li>
    <li>{l('Jobmote', 'http://jobmote.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('Jobspresso', 'https://jobspresso.co')}</li>
    <li>{l('Landing.jobs', 'https://landing.jobs')}</li>
    <li>{l('RemoteCoder', 'https://remotecoder.io/')} (aggregator)</li>
    <li>{l('Remotely Awesome Jobs', 'https://www.remotelyawesomejobs.com/')} (aggregator)</li>
    <li>{l('RemoteOK', 'https://remoteok.io/')} (aggregator)</li>
    <li>{l('Remotive Jobs', 'http://jobs.remotive.io/')}</li>
    <li>{l('Virtual Vocations', 'https://www.virtualvocations.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('We Work Remotely', 'https://weworkremotely.com')}</li>
    <li>{l('WFH.io', 'https://www.wfh.io')}</li>
    <li>{l('Who is hiring', 'https://whoishiring.io/')} (aggregator)</li>
    <li>{l('Working Nomads', 'http://www.workingnomads.co')} (aggregator)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you target a specific technology, check first if there's a job board for to that tech - they tend to be great insiders' listings. Eg {l('Go', 'http://www.golangprojects.com/golang-remote-jobs.html')}, {l('Python','http://www.pythonjobs.com/')}, {l('Ionic','http://jobs.ionic.io/')}, etc.</p>
  <h5>The OK</h5>
  <p>The following boards "mean well," but through which I've never found me solid work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>{l('Gun.io', 'https://gun.io/')} - great system, but their job churn is slow. I rarely see new posts.</li>
    <li>{l('PeoplePerHour', 'http://www.peopleperhour.com/')} - started off fantastic, but began leaning offshore, rendering rates non-competitive.</li>
    <li>{l('Hasjob', 'https://hasjob.co')} - my experience was mostly low-paying offshore jobs.</li>
    <li>{l('Flexjobs', 'https://www.flexjobs.com')}</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>The Ugly</h4>
  <p>And finally, the penny boards (aka bid boards, content mills, etc). Posted by upstart college-grads looking for a $100 Facebook clone; your competition is offshore highly-experienced professionals charging $5/h. Which means (a) you won't make western wages; (b) you likely won't even land the gig. While I disparage these boards for finding quality gigs yourself, they're great for two things. (1) Building your portfolio in unfamiliar technology (you're bootstrapping or pivoting). (2) Hiring talent for <em>your</em> projects - I use these sites for commissioning logos, icons, and discrete chunks of small independent work.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>oDesk / Elance / Upwork (all the same, rebranded as Upwork)</li>
    <li>Freelancer</li>
    <li>Guru</li>
    <li>Fiverr</li>
  </ul>

  {/*<h4>Jobpig</h4>
  <p>{l('Jobpig','https://jobpigapp.com')} is my favorite, but I'm biased. It aggregates the highest quality boards above, so you only have to look in one location. And instead of using search, you <em>rate</em> jobs (thumbs up/down, like Pandora) which teaches it your search preferences so it can find the best-matching posts. If you're a digital nomad, be sure to seed it with the "Remote" tag. {l('Give it a shot!','https://jobpigapp.com')}</p>*/}
