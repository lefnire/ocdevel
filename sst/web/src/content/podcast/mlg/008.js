  body: `
Come back here after you've finished Ng's course; or learn these resources in tandem with ML (say 1 day a week).

- Linear Algebra = Matrix (or "Tensor") math. Wx + b. Chopping in our analogy.
- Stats = Probability/inference, the heart of machine learning. Recipes/cookbook.
- Calculus = Learning. Moving our error dot to the bottom of the valley. Baking, the actual "cook" step.`
