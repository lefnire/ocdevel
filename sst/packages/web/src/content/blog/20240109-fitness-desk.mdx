ADHD, broke, and busy. Stopped Adderall a while back, found that a fitness desk did as much to help as the meds. Treadmills occupy the jitters part of your brain. Transformative, along with the [Modified Pomodoro Technique](/blog/20240117-pomodoro-thinkers). Moving keeps blood and endorphins pumping, keeping you alert and on task all day. Oxygen and endorphins help not just with energy, but focus. Caffeine intake is significantly reduced when at fitness desk. Weight-loss: At my best, I've clocked 320 active zone minutes (Fitbit) in a day. That's 5.3 hrs of gym time. At worst, I do 10k steps, the minimum recommendation. This saves gym time and money. Posture is improved while walking. Obviously compared to sitting; but even more than standing.
