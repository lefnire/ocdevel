ADHD, broke, and busy. Stopped Adderall a while back, found that a fitness desk did as much to help as the meds. Treadmills occupy the jitters part of your brain. Transformative, along with the [Modified Pomodoro Technique](/blog/20240117-pomodoro-thinkers). Moving keeps blood and endorphins pumping, keeping you alert and on task all day. Oxygen and endorphins help not just with energy, but focus. Caffeine intake is significantly reduced when at fitness desk. Weight-loss: At my best, I've clocked 320 active zone minutes (Fitbit) in a day. That's 5.3 hrs of gym time. At worst, I do 10k steps, the minimum recommendation. This saves gym time and money. Posture is improved while walking. Obviously compared to sitting; but even more than standing.

<span className="text-bg-warning">Update 2024-02-19</span> I've overhauled this post. I previously recommended GoYouth, which is still a fantastic treadmill. But after 2 years of full-time walking, my knees hurt. Researching, I found a 3% incline is recommended in sports medicine; Egofit's hard-set incline, they did their research. Egofit also has shock absorption, easier access to under-belt lubing, tricks for reduced depth to save space, and a larger weight capacity. GoYouth served me very well; but Egofit has a lot of well-thought alterations. Scroll all the way down to see previous research or compare other products you may have heard about. Specifically if you don't want Egofit, choose Urevo.
