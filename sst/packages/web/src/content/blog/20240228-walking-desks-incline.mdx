You've decided to use an [under-desk treadmill / walking pad](https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240109-fitness-desk) while working. You'll use this any amount of an 8-hour work day, and it's possible you'll do the full 8 (I've done it). Your speed will range between 1-3 miles per hour; and by week's end, you've put it more mileage than any sane exercise regime (up to 960 miles). So you *really* need to get the ergonomics right.

### Ergonomics

3% was decided as the optimal incline for walking / running ([1](https://www.accesssportsmed.com/news/prevent-knee-injuries-when-running-on-the-treadmill/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20setting%20the%20treadmill%20incline,would%20find%20when%20running%20outside), [2](https://plancherortho.com/protect-your-knees-while-running-on-the-treadmill/)). The very slight upward climb reduces the distance to impact (reducing the impact), reduces hyper-extension, and stabilizes the right muscles around the knees. This makes choosing a treadmill easy, since only [a few](https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240109-fitness-desk) offer incline at all, and [only one](https://egofitwalker.com/products/egofit-comfortdeck-m2-under-desk-treadmill?sca_ref=5484370.9SQi3qcg7q&sca_source=blog) has 3% as a fixed incline. The latter is the best option, since it's body is built around that specific incline; and it has shock absorption tailored for knee-health.

Take heed. I walked two years on a flat treadmill and messed up my knees (hence my research). When I switched to an incline my knees improved. Some worry about lower back strain as a trade-off, but I've never experienced lower back pain in either regime. Your back and posture are already improved by walking over sitting, so any concern here is negligible compared to knee health.

### Calories and Stability

A 3% incline adds 20-30% more calorie expenditure for the same speed. This means you can set the speed to 20% less than you'd normally walk for the same benefits, meaning you're reclaiming stability at the desk (mouse and keyboard precision). Or you can walk at the same speed as before and lose more weight (I do the latter).

### Treadmill Longevity

Two things: (1) motor life; (2) walking pad impact. (1) The treadmill's motor expenditure and wear is based on speed alone. So if you reduce speed by 20% for the same human effort (above), you'll reduce motor load by 20%. (2) The incline reduces the distance to impact, meaning there's less of an impact on the walking pad when foot touches down. This improves health on knees, and improves health on the walking pad of the treadmill. [Egofit](https://egofitwalker.com/products/egofit-comfortdeck-m2-under-desk-treadmill?sca_ref=5484370.9SQi3qcg7q&sca_source=blog) in particular has some honeycomb shock-absorption tech which receives impact better, meaning the walking pad takes doubly-less damage. All this adds up, as it's not uncommon to create cracks on budget-mill walking pads over time.

Now that you know all this, take the same knowledge to the gym any time you run on a standard treadmill. 3% should be your fixed incline, no more no less.
