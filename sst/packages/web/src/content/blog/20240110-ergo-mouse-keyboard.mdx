I developed RSI (Repetitive Stress Injury) in my wrist and thumb from overworking. Others develop CTS (Carpal Tunnel Syndrome); they're very similar. This is common in tech workers using a standard mouse; we're not meant for prolonged motion at that pronated angle. This is exacerbated when on a fitness desk (treadmill or stepper), since the back-and-forth / up-and-down motion increases such movement on the wrist. It also develops from squeezing the wrists inward on a standard keyboard, *especially* a compact one (eg laptop). I solved this *definitively* by switching to a trackball mouse and a tented split mechanical keyboard. The fix has been permanent, and RSI only flares up when I'm traveling with a laptop without my ergo peripherals for a long while. Some resort to compression gloves, but that only reduces the pain; it doesn't remove the source, like ergo peripherals do.

### Mouse

TL;DR: [Slimblade Pro](https://amzn.to/47BxLgJ)

First, let's rule out mice which add ergonomics to the standard layout. These include ergo mice like [Logitech MX Master](https://amzn.to/3NZ24r3); and vertical mice like [Logitech Lift](https://amzn.to/3HcIZxs) or [Logitech MX Vertical](https://amzn.to/3TOKjOO). While an ergonomic grip does reduce (MX Master) or remove (MX Vertical) the pronated angle of the wrist, the motion in the wrist to move the mouse still contributes to RSI. Many will use these mice and feel better; but won't get *all the way* better. I experimented with these for a year (before my deep-dive) and experienced just that. For reference: the "MX" series are their higher quality products; where the non-MXs (eg Lift, M575) are their budget products. In general, I don't recommend Logitech for ergonomics; their products are high quality, but they play it too safe on design, not wanting to dive into niche territory due to the smaller audience. Eg, they don't have finger-ball mice or split keyboards.

The solution is track-balls. Yes, the mice you remember your antisocial gamer uncle using in the 90s. Trust me, these are the solution for RSI / CTS.

First, let's rule out thumb-balls. The next step people often take after a failed experiment with vertical mice, is thumb-ball mice, like [MX Ergo Plus](https://amzn.to/3Hcq3zd) (quality) or [M575](https://amzn.to/3OlJjyf) (budget). They do this (and I did this) because the layout is closer to a standard mouse; just replacing the bottom sensor with a thumb-ball. It's easier to adapt. The problem you quickly face is that moving the thumb that much is as bad on the thumb joints, as moving your pronated hand is on the wrists. Now you face RSI in the thumb. Thumbs aren't meant for that amount of static motion. Nor are they very precise, so users will suffer from reduced effectiveness of mouse-usage. Many swear by these, but those with strong RSI feel the difference easily. I own both listed, and when I use one now for reference, indeed my thumb joints hurt.

Solution: finger-balls. Finger-ball trackball mice have you using your middle or index finger to move a (usually very large, better ergonomics and precision) ball. Due to this, their layouts are much different than you're used to; which is why people often avoid them (they have a learning curve). As it goes, the weirder the layout, generally the better the ergonomics (eg [Slimblade Pro](https://amzn.to/47BxLgJ) being endgame, IMO). Now we're talking about the "right" ergo mice, let's compare a few popular options, before we land on my recommended end-game, Slimblade Pro.

- [X-keys L-Trac](https://xkeys.com/l-tracblu.html). This is popular amongst the die-hards. As I understand, the laser sensor and bearings are much better higher quality than most others, making precision top-notch. There are only two buttons, however, which is a deal-breaker for me (a programmer who uses middle-click and back frequently). It's a relatively old product, and I feel hardware has improved.
- ELECOM [Huge](https://amzn.to/48LYA2N) and [Deft Pro](https://amzn.to/3HgaiY4). Their variants of the same concept; the Huge being, well Huge, and intended for your battle station where it never moves. The size allows for a larger ball (which improves ergonomics and precision) and comfortable hand-rest. The Deft Pro being smaller is meant for more flexible setups; one-size-fits-all (in case you don't have the desk space, or you may want to travel with it). The ELECOM mice have a layout more familiar to traditionalists, which make them attractive to newcomers. They have two main problems. (1) Their ball bearings are notoriously bad, and most ELECOM die-hards will replace them. This is a makers task; the bearings aren't meant to just be replaced, you'll spend hours on YouTube. (2) The scroll-wheels are thumb-operated. Per above, too much thumb activity risks RSI, and scrolling you scroll more than you realize. I do, however, recommend their little tiny [bitra](https://amzn.to/3SaKF0O) for traveling. It fits into your pocket, and is better ergonomics than a laptop trackpad. having a scroll thumb-wheel, it's not perfect ergonomically (don't use it for your daily driver); but it's handy in a pinch.
- Kensington [Orbit Fusion](https://amzn.to/3vu8jg7). Getting closer to proper ergonomics, but still suffers from thumb buttons. Also, the buttons are "squishy" - I find their quality quite low (surprising, since Kensington's other products are so high-quality.)
- Kensington [Expert](https://amzn.to/47uPExU). *Very* popular, and just one step away from end-game. But skip this and go Slimblade; Slimblade is really the "new Expert". The only reason I think people still buy this older Kensington, is (1) legacy / outdated recommendations online; (2) it has a physical scroll-wheel, which some prefer to Slimblade's "virtual" scrolling. Note: the angle on the Slimblade makes for poor ergonomics, unless you get a wrist cushion. Really, if you're going to get the Expert, just get the Slimbade instead.

Kensington [Slimblade Pro](https://amzn.to/3RX6tvA) is the latest iteration of the [Slimblade](https://amzn.to/3RWvpDo). It has wireless (2.4ghz USB), wired, or bluetooth; it's rare mice offer all 3, so that's a big deal. If you know you want wired-only, you can get the non-pro and save money. But I recommend the Pro, so you can travel easily with it, or use it on a future device you didn't anticipate. The square format takes getting used to, but you'll be glad you did. You'll use all five fingers: middle for ball, and the other four for the 4 buttons as you'd guess. Even though you use your thumb, which I've been recommending against, you do so in a downward press rather than back-and-forth motion required by the other mice. Virtually no impact on thumb RSI. And I recommend hovering your hand over the whole device, like Saruman over the Palantir (Google the image); rather than resting your hand on anything. To scroll, you rotate the ball. As you get used to this you'll find yourself grabbing it full-on and turning it; but you'll slowly progress towards sort of "wiping" your ring finger or middle finger along the edge. Once you're used to the layout, scrolling, and ball (which admittedly takes time), you'll find it difficult to use anything else. And a HUGE benefit of the Slimblade over the others is it's ambidextrous; meaning you can switch hands. If you do, you'll use [Kensington Works](https://www.kensington.com/software/kensingtonworks/) to map the keys as mirrored. Personally I switched to my left hand to let my right-hand RSI heal up. But by the time it did, I was so used to left-handed Slimblade that I never went back.

### Keyboard

A properly-ergonomic keyboard is split and tented. TODO I need to finish this, but for now look at Glove80
