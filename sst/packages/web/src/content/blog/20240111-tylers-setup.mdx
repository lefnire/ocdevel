The [MLG Resources](/mlg/resources) page is for education content to follow the podcast. But there's also battle-station hardware and software I live and die by. I'll continue to modify this list as time goes on.

- [Gaming and machine learning laptop](/blog/20240108-ml-gaming-laptop). I swear by Legion Pro, esp. for ML training and gaming.
- [Fitness desk](/blog/20240109-fitness-desk). Fitness desks mitigate ADHD powerfully, and improve health.
- [Ergonomic mouse & keyboard](/blog/20240110-ergo-mouse-keyboard). These reduce RSI (repetitive stress injury) and CTS (carpal tunnel syndrome) for us techies.
- [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) (PyCharm). Packs more punch than VSCode; but steeper learning curve.
- [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) for podcasting (audio or video editing).
