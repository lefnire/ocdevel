      <outline text="Why fitness desk">
        <outline text="ADHD" _note="Treadmills in particular, where you set a speed and it &quot;moves you&quot; (you just keep up) occupy a jitters part of your brain, like a fidget-spinner. It &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; helps with ADHD; one of the only things that works for me (along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ocdevel.com/blog/20240117-pomodoro-thinkers&quot;&gt;Modified Pomodoro&lt;/a&gt;). I've read many similar experiences.&#10;" />
        <outline text="Energy" _note="Moving keeps blood and endorphins pumping. It keeps you alert and on task all day. Oxygen and endorphins help not just with energy, but focus. My caffeine intake is significantly reduced when I'm at a walking desk.&#10;" />
        <outline text="Health" _note="Calories and heart-rate. At my best, I've clocked 320 active zone minutes (Fitbit) in a day. That's 5.3 hrs of gym time. Excessive likely - should probably be re-evaluated - but suffice it eliminates the gym, saving time and money. At my worst, I go around 5 miles in a day; that's the 10k steps minimum recommendation. That is: my worst day is still the minimum recommended. Further, your posture is improved while walking. Obviously compared to sitting; but I've found posture is better walking than standing. &#10;" />
      </outline>
      <outline text="Machine">
        <outline text="Filters &amp; info">
          <outline text="Click some of these based on requirements #electric:yes #electric:no #budget:low #budget:high #size:small #size:large #picked-by:op #picked-by:public #speed:high #speed:low #incline:yes">
            <outline text="Electric" _note="Yes if it plugs into the wall / uses electricity. The benefit is that it &quot;moves you&quot; (you set a speed an keep up), rather than you &quot;moving it&quot;. When the machine moves you, there's a lot less mental load to engage the machine while you're working. This is especially a problem with sit-down under-desk mini bikes; the distraction is pretty significant. The distraction is medium with a stepper (Xiser). The distraction is not only gone, but &lt;i&gt;improved&lt;/i&gt;, with an electric treadmill; since the automation of it occupies the jittery part of your brain. If distraction is a big issue for you, you should consider an electric treadmill. But the downside, of course, is that it uses electricity, thus money. And requires an available outlet, which maybe your circumstances don't allow. Nor are these devices portable, compared to the Xiser which you can pack into check-in luggage. As for me, I alternate between the two. When very mentally off, I use the treadmill. When I have energy, I use the Xiser." />
            <outline text="Budget" _note="This is the price-to-quality trade-off. The budget picks (eg GoYouth), you'll see I describe as &quot;surprisingly good&quot; - which means relative to the price. If price (and other factors like size, portability) aren't an issue, you should go for the more expensive machines, like LifeSpan; they will definitely last longer and need less maintenance. If this has you anxious (you want to save money, but you want quality) then click budget:low, the budget picks are still quite good.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Size" _note="Xiser is a mini stepper, and so portable you can stuff it in a suitcase and fly. That's one extreme. For the treadmills though, there's quite a range in WxHxL dimensions which could make a difference with (a) how much space you have at your home; (b) how much space is available between the legs of a desk you may already own. Most standard 1-person desks won't fit all the treadmills on this list, so measure the space between your desk legs and look at the product listings' dimensions before purchasing.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Picked-by" _note="OP (&quot;original poster&quot;, aka me) or the public. By public I mean, from what I've seen these are popular picks; sometimes not aligning with what I'd personally choose. Eg, the iMovr is usually considered higher quality than Lifespan, but I'd pick Lifespan personally given the limiting specs on the iMovR.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Speed" _note="Some of the treadmills cap at 2-2.5mph, which is a good average (a speed I'd recommend for most people). I personally walk at 3.5mph, so I need the speed. If you're relatively fit and want to get more oomph, pick one that goes beyond 2.5mph (pick speed:high). One twist here is Xiser; it's the only option which doesn't offer speed:low. Xiser's lowest intensity has me at around 120 BPM (beats per minute), which is moderate-to-intense exercise. You'll need gym clothes and a towel, and coworkers who don't care how you appear in meetings. The upside is removing the gym from your life entirely, this is well beyond enough. Because of Xiser, I add speed:low AND speed:high where relevant (Xiser is the only one without speed:low)&#10;" />
            <outline text="Incline" _note="Very few of these offer an incline; the posterchild being EgoFit. Incline is much better for your knees, and since you'll be on this all day that is very important in the long run. The downside is it takes a lot of height, which added to your own may be too much for your standing desk and monitors to position ergonomically. Measure your setup to see if you can add incline, and if it can (mine can't) then seriously consider incline options.&#10;" />
          </outline>
          <outline text="Notes">
            <outline text="Ratings" _note="I personally find 1-star skews to be the best indicator of review-based quality (along with reading those 1-stars). A huge 1-star bar often indicates fake positive reviews, or at least big quality control issues. Also use Fakespot Chrome plugin to see the fakeness score (A-F)." />
            <outline text="Age" _note="Newer devices are better. A great example is the GoPlus; it's the most popular budget treadmill, but I chose against it in my prior review due to limitations in size, speed, and weight capacity. The latest one fixes all that. Clearly they've made enough money from the prior product's popularity to pour into development against its main complaints. So take note of the age in the &quot;specs&quot; sections; and before you buy anything, make sure to go to that company's store page on Amazon, and find the most recent version of the same product, in case my link is for an older version.&#10;" />
            <outline text="Max-weight" _note="If you're 220 or over, look at the max-weight! I think only GoYouth has that limitation on this list, but those that didn't make my list have the limitation as well. If you're under 220, selection doesn't matter; that tends to be the minimum max-weight I see around. Are you exactly 220? Don't do risk it; get the next weight-class up. &#10;" />
            <outline text="Assembly" _note="None of the machines require assembly, so that's awesome. Even with Xiser, it's more &quot;unflattening&quot; it, which takes less than a minute. The standing desks are another story... I hated assembling my Flexispot.&#10;" />
          </outline>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Treadmills">
          <outline text="Budget" _note="The budget mills can be more loud, and deal less effectively with heat. To deal with this, reduce the amount of at-one-time walking (eg 30-45 min on, 2-5 min break). Generally expect to get around 2 years out of these mills; compared to the non-budgets which could last a life-time. Personally I take the trade-off; I don't know where I'll be in 2 years, and I also have an extended warranty. You can buy a new budget-mill every 2 years for 12 years before you hit the cost of the non-budgets.&#10;">

If you choose GoYouth, go to their &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4aKjql7&quot;&gt;store page&lt;/a&gt; just to make sure there's nothing newer than the link I posted. These budget brands often release newer versions quite frequently; and newer is better with these.&#10;">

              <outline text="Pros">
                <outline text="Surprisingly durable" _note="I've been using it for 2yrs, around 6hrs per day 5 days a week. I'm 220lbs and I walk 3.5mph. That's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; intense usage to have lasted this long. Just recently it started to develop creaks and groans, which I believe is due to damage I put on the walking pad from the usage. But I think it has another 6 months left in it before I need to use the extended warranty.&#10;" />
                <outline text="Smaller than many others" _note="Making it fit under more desks. No rails.&#10;" />
                <outline text="Up to 6mph" _note="I like to walk 3.5mph while working; faster than most walking treadmills allow. I wouldn't recommend using this to run/sprint though, unless you absolutely must (no nearby gym, bad weather, etc). While it's quite durable, I fear my 220lbs landing too hard on the pad would cause cracks.&#10;" />
              </outline>
              <outline text="Cons">
                <outline text="Controller sucks" _note="But can easily be replaced for free. Just deal with it. The first one will have button-presses miss-firing (as in, activating a different button's action). To fix this, buy a compatible controller battery along with the treadmill and replace the one in the controller immediately. I think they just run out while sitting in the warehouse. After 1.5yrs, I nonetheless had to do a hard replacement, which GoYouth did for free via Amazon messaging center. It was easy, came fast, and didn't phase me. This isn't a fluke; you'll see in the reviews many have experienced this scenario. &#10;" />
                <outline text="Low max weight" _note="220 is lower than 265 average of the budget picks. &#10;" />

                <outline text="Incline" _note="The only mill with a hard-set incline (5%, unchangeable). This makes is tall (6.89&quot;H) which may or may not accommodate your desk height for ergonomic peripherals and monitor placement, so do some measurements beforehand. If it works height-wise, then this is a great pick because an incline is significantly better for your knees, which is very important for long-term use. This will be my next pick when I upgrade my desk.&#10;" />
                <outline text="Size" _note="I excluded size:small and size:large tags because it's a bit of both. It's large in that it's tall. However, it's smaller than most treadmills depth-wise, which reduces the walking surface. If you need the extra room in your space to not have something jutting out from your desk, this is a pro. But if that doesn't matter, than the reduced depth can take some adjusting in walking style.&#10;" />

            <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vxMSuh&quot;&gt;GoPlus&lt;/a&gt; #budget:low  #size:small #electric:yes #picked-by:public #speed:low #speed:high #c" _note="I actually hadn't seen this version of the product before starting this post. The one I knew was &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3vsjtC1&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which I had in reference to shit on GoPlus in this post. So I've nested the original product assessment below, and will just dump some specs for the new product here. Frankly, if this new GoPlus holds up, it could be more compelling than the GoYouth since the main gripes seem gone (size, speed, etc) - plus it's cheaper. If you go with GoPlus, I recommend ignoring my specific links and manually going through their &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3S8VDnA&quot;&gt;store page&lt;/a&gt; to find whatever's newest, which fits your bill. &#10;">
              <outline text="Pros">
                <outline text="Most popular budget-pick" _note="This is the go-to when people are researching budget treadmills.

                <outline text="New release. Smaller, faster, cheaper, and bears more weight." _note="If it weren't for this new product (the link above), I would NOT recommend GoPlus. All the issues it had in specs though are mitigated with this new one. Strangely there's two in their store with the same title but different prices: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3H6Ix42&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3HaJ6Kc&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.

                <outline text="Belt drift" _note="One of the biggest reasons I chose GoYouth over GoPlus was how many complaints against belt drift there were in the comments. Belt drift is fixable via an Alan wrench, but unfortunately once it starts, it won't stop (you have to continue to adjust once a week or so). The GoYouth took me a full 1.5yrs to develop drift; but the GoPlus users experience it right away. So this was a big problem in the original product - the new product has only 12 reviews (as of &lt;time startYear=&quot;2024&quot; startMonth=&quot;1&quot; startDay=&quot;7&quot;&gt;Sun, Jan 7, 2024&lt;/time&gt;, between the two duplicate listings) but one of the reviews is a 1-star about belt-drift.

Do a bit more research.&#10;" />
              </outline>
            </outline>
            <outline text="Considerations">
              <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4aKYDhi&quot;&gt;Lube&lt;/a&gt;" _note="Every so often, apply this lube in a zig-zag motion under the belt (between belt and pad). Then run the treadmill at 1mph for 2 minutes without walking on it. This reduces heat build-up on the pad; which heat would be transferred to the motor, which would cause degradation. The instructions are &quot;once every 3-6 months, or every 130 miles&quot; - but I do this every Monday morning to be on the safe side. This is the core maintenance task; one you should take fairly seriously. A perk of Xiser is it requires no maintenance, unlike treadmills.&#10;" />
              <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/4aJnyBV&quot;&gt;Controller batteries&lt;/a&gt;" _note="If you get a treadmill with a mini controller (like GoYouth or GoPlus), get some batteries. In fact, replace the batteries as soon as you can. With GoYouth at least, it seems many of the controller complaints are a spent battery upon arrival. &#10;" />
              <outline text="Get the extended warranty!" _note="Asurion or whatever it is. With the budget treadmills, since YYMV and the reviews are fairly inconsistent, you'll want the peace of mind. I'd estimate the lifespan of them to be 2 years, based on my own experience (I'm 1.5yrs in with &lt;i&gt;very heavy&lt;/i&gt; usage / abuse, and it's only now starting to show slight issues which will likely get worse in the next 6 months).&#10;" />
              <outline text="Adjusting the belt" _note="If the belt starts to drift one way or another, you take an Alan wrench and tighten &lt;i&gt;the side which is too tight / close (not not the side with slack)&lt;/i&gt;. This pulls the belt away from that too-tight side towards the slack side. Think of it as if you created a slope that the belt rolls down. Do quarter turns clock-wise while the belt is running, wait 15 seconds to see if it fixes itself, and do another quarter turn if not (repeat until it's fixed). Then you just leave it - it's something I don't understand, not &quot;undoing&quot; the tightening after the fix, but whatever - you just leave it. This situation happens say once every week or two, is something you do with all the treadmills; necessary evil.&#10;" />
              <outline text="Walk 30-45 min, break 1-5 min" _note="Budget mills deal less effectively with heat. To deal with this, reduce the amount of at-one-time walking. I recommend 30-45 minutes of walking, and a 1-5 minute break (turn off via remote). The occasional hour or two won't kill these machines; but running the belt for 8hrs a day might. I'm a fan of the Pomodoro Technique for focus management. You work for 25 minutes (don't check emails / texts / Slack, nothing - pure hardcore work) and then take a break for 5 minutes to catch up on everything, or just de-steam. This fits perfectly with the treadmill. Work for 25-30, turn it off and go check your texts in the bathroom or whatever for 5 min, repeat. &#10;" />

          </outline>
          <outline text="Non-budget" _note="These can bear more weight than the budget picks, and can run continuously for much longer. They're quieter, and they're likely to need less servicing (though I haven't needed to service my GoYouth yet, and I contend that the budget picks are less an issue in terms of quality; and more an issue in terms of using them smartly, like non-continuous use)&#10;">

So just pick whichever price point you're most comfortable with. They're also increasingly heavy / large, and accommodate increasing weight. So factor that into your decision. Note: I'm not sure what the difference between the models GlowUp, Classic, Power, and Omni. I think the GlowUp means &quot;just the treadmill&quot; where the other ones are different spins on the &quot;and also the desk&quot; - but you'll want to research some.&#10;">

You'll find on treadmills you'll frequently static-shock your components; some people use an ESD wrist-strap for this reason. Not an issue with Xiser. BTW, don't worry about ESD with treadmills if you use my keyboard/mouse recommends; the touch parts are plastic (even if they're connected via USB), and I've only experienced shock when I touch the laptop directly.&#10;" />

              <outline text="Small / portable" _note="Not only is it small enough to fit under any desk, or within a confined setup; but it's small enough to put into a suitcase and travel with (I've done this over the holidays). It breaks down and folds flat. &#10;" />
              <outline text="Invincible" _note="I know it's cringy I keep using this word, but I've seen others use it; and having validated this, I'm parroting. I've left it in the rain on accident. I've spilled a soft drink in around the pistons. At first it lost resistance and made bad sounds, I could smell the sugar burning; then it just burned it off and went back to normal. When I first assembled it, the head wasn't aligned on the piston correctly; had an &quot;oh shit&quot; moment after days like that, fixed it - never seen any negative effect. It went through check-in ruffage. I've used it for multiple hours at a time without a break (something I wouldn't do with my GoYouth). I don't know why I treat this thing so poorly; likely just because I trust it so much. &#10;" />
              <outline text="Stability" _note="Surprisingly, stepping is a more stable motion for computing than is walking. Walking creates a back and forth motion that you have less control over; where stepping you fully control the motion, and it's up and down. And if you do it right, it's not your whole body going up and down; but just your legs. So you'll have less trouble getting precise mouse-clicks on a stepper than on a treadmill. Though, unless you're going 3.5mph or more on a treadmill, this shouldn't be an issue anyway; just a small point.&#10;">
                <outline text="Better for gaming" _note="Since precision on mouse and keyboard is essential while gaming, a Xiser is better than a treadmill. The main trade-off is focus; but let's be honest - you won't have difficulty focusing while gaming - that's only a struggle during work. I step more consistently when gaming, since I'm in the zone, so I get a better workout.&#10;" />
              </outline>
              <outline text="No shoes needed" _note="Though highly recommended, just for foot health (cushioning). But a treadmill will absolutely eat through your shoes, a cost you haven't thought of.&#10;" />
            </outline>
            <outline text="Cons">
              <outline text="Hardcore" _note="The easiest setting (you turn a dial) on the Xiser is still the equivalent, I'd guess, of running 5-6mph. There's nothing lower than that. My Fitbit clocks me at 120bpm, and 30 active-zone minutes per 30 stepping minutes. It's a real workout. Note: unlike a treadmill at 6mph, which would be too unstable to work (from the bouncing and keeping up); there's no loss in stability or precision when stepping, since it's all localized motion. So this added physical effort doesn't translate to more difficult computing; it's purely for consideration in what level of physical effort you're willing to exert while working. Think about face-time meetings, whether you want to wear gym clothes while working, etc. I personally do use the Xiser many days of the week (when I have good energy), because my coworkers don't care and I like the exercise. &#10;" />
              <outline text="Mental effort" _note="This is the biggest difference between electric and non-electric machines. Electric machines (like treadmills) &quot;move you&quot;, and you just have to keep up. this actually improves your focus since it gets the jitters out. But machines you manually engage (like the Xiser) require some mental effort to remember to push. I find I still focus better on a Xiser than while standing or sitting; my thinking is the endorphins and blood-flow make up for the loss. But of all the manual machines I've used for fitness desks, Xiser requires the least mental effort, since there's a certain amount of required momentum and consistency to keep the thing going; compared to Sunny Health or under-desk bikes, where the resistance 1-1 tied to the push.&#10;" />

            <outline text="Considerations">
              <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/48IAIx1&quot;&gt;Silicone Teflon Spray&lt;/a&gt;" _note="If you hear creaking sounds, it's not mechanical - it's metal on metal. This is the response I got from Xiser support; which when implemented fixed the sound issue. Surprisingly the sounds never returned, so it doesn't seem like a maintenance issue but a fix:&#10;&quot;If a clicking or creaking sound is coming from your machine while in use, it is not damaging your machine.  Most likely, one of the connecting bolts needs a little lubrication.  Use a silicone spray.  One with Teflon is superior.  Do not use WD40.  Spray where the cables connect to the pedals and where the cables connect to the cap that fits on top of the pistons.  You can also lubricate inside the cap before placing it on the piston.  Do not spray the piston or try and manipulate the piston in any way.&quot;&#10;" />
            </outline>
          </outline>
          <outline text="Other steppers and bikes - DON'T DO IT" _note="If you don't go with a treadmill, buy the Xiser. Do NOT buy any other stepper or bike. I've owned many steppers, including the most popularly-recommended Sunny Health steppers. None of them have lasted more than a few months. &#10;">
            <outline text="Steppers" _note="They can't handle extended use. Heat builds up in the pistons, and you'll start to hear loud wheezing on each down-push; followed shortly after with a loss of all resistance. It's called &quot;leaky cylinders&quot;, and they don't recover from this - they're toast. I don't know what it is about Xiser, but every review I've read pegs it for durability and extended use. I've used mine for 1.5 years, for hours at a time. I haven't used it as much as the GoYouth, but definitely enough to prove its durability. I've also abused the hell out of it traveling, and the thing just won't break. Plus they have a 5 year warranty (because they're so confident).&#10;" />
            <outline text="Bikes" _note="Under-desk bikes are also very prone to break, I've owned a few of these. More importantly though, by sitting and pedaling, you're manually engaging the bike in a way requiring more mental effort than a standing stepper (which grants some &quot;automation&quot; just in the down push). A standing stepper like Xiser already has the con of mental effort as you have to &quot;move it&quot;, compared to treadmills &quot;moving you&quot; (which removes the mental effort). Under-desk cyclers effectively double that mental effort. So you'll find that when you're thinking about cycling, you'll engage it; but now you're not thinking about work. When you're in the zone working, you'll totally stop cycling. It defeats the purpose. I haven't met someone who's owned an under-desk cycler who used it longer than a week.&#10;" />

      <outline text="Standing board" _note="Sometimes you don't feel like walking or stepping. In an effort to minimize sitting, I spent a long time researching the perfect standing setup. Standing on a hard surface for prolonged periods is NOT good for you (even with good shoes); it's better to just sit. So my next move was standing-specific mats. When things really changed was in exploring wobble boards (Yes4All, Fezibo, Gymba, etc). By wobbling, you're exerting a sort of added &quot;cushion&quot; which lets your body alleviate tension here then there. It's less effort, and more comfort, than you'd think. Plus this improves posture, and evidently burns some 200-300 calories extra per 8hr standing day. I went through quite a few of these, but they all suffered from a lack of good angle or weight distribution. Eg, Yes4All is too &quot;ballerina pose&quot;. Fezibo has you over-pronating, which is terrible for your ankles. Revbalance is too hard-core, there's no way you'll focus while surfing. So the end-game was Fluidstance. &#10;">
        <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://fluidstance.com/pages/the-plane-cloud&quot;&gt;FluidStance PlaneCloud&lt;/a&gt;" _note="You'll want the cushioned one specifically (PlaneCloud). Prolonged standing is so hard on your feet, that you need all the cushion you can get. The top is cushioned, the wobbling aspect itself provides a pseudo &quot;cushion&quot; (you're sort of floating around), and I recommend also wearing shoes. Cushion!&#10;" />

        <outline text="Standing Desk" _note="I don't remember my research, so unless anyone wants me to dig into pros/cons I'll just roll with what I landed on back then: Flexispot. You'll definitely want an electric desk which can sit or stand, because after walking or standing all day, you'll need a break sometimes. You'll also want a wide one which can accommodate any sized treadmill, and maybe even keeping the treadmill on one side permanently and the chair or board on the other side (though you'll have to be thoughtful of the monitor placement).  If you want that double-side setup, target 55&quot; width or more.&#10;">

        <outline text="Ergo keyboard &amp; mouse" _note="When you're walking or stepping, you're moving your arms more than usual. People often develop RSI (Repetitive Stress Injury, a cousin of Carpal Tunnel) when seated with a standard mouse, due to the arm motion - that type of wrist motion is bad for you. This is amplified big-time on fitness desks, due to the fitness motion. It could take 6 months, it could take a 5 years, but almost everyone I've talked to who have fitness desks have experienced an RSI uptick. Ergo peripherals solve this definitively. &#10;">

        <outline text="Optional #c" _note="Just a bit of extra stuff I use, which may you'll find handy too&#10;">
          <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/48oewbX&quot;&gt;Fingerless gloves&lt;/a&gt;" _note="Since you'll be sweating a bunch, get some cheap cloth fingerless gloves to catch the sweat so it doesn't get on your keyboard or mouse. I tried wrist-bands, but it didn't catch sweat from the hands themselves.&#10;" />
          <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3RVMY6y&quot;&gt;Phone arm&lt;/a&gt;" _note="Using arms / clips / holders as much as possible frees up desk-space. Eg, the phone now hovers rather than taking up desk space. Makes your phone more ergonomic / hands-free too. &#10;" />
          <outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3TVfIyZ&quot;&gt;USB-C Hub&lt;/a&gt;" _note="If your computer's USB-C is close-enough (eg on the desk), a hub / docking-station is great for plugging in all the monitors and peripherals to a single USB-C port on your computer. If it's a laptop, you can then just unplug one thing to go portable. I'm a huge fan of WAVLINK and NewQ; they're new-ish off-brands, compared to Anker which has gotten too big for its britches as an off-brand and is now too expensive (the AirBnB effect)&#10;" />

IETS stands are widely known as virtually &lt;b&gt;the only&lt;/b&gt; fan bases which work! This is coming from me who doesn't even own one (I have a different fan base, and I have buyer's remorse). I saved this link a while back, so search AliExpress for a newer model from the same brand. I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; GT5000 might be the latest?&#10;">
            <outline text="Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/48N3pcb&quot;&gt;laptop tray&lt;/a&gt;" _note="Alternatively, if you want your laptop on one of the monitor arms (say you only have one monitor, but two arms), then you could use a laptop tray to get the laptop positioned a bit better. But I personally prefer: two monitors on the arms, stacked height-wise (both portrait layout) on the right-side; my laptop on a fan base on the left side. The fan base adds a lot of height to the monitor, so it's positioned where I want it eye-wise.&#10;" />
